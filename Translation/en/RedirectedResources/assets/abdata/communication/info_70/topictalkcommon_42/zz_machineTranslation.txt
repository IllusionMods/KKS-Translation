「どれも楽しそうだし、片っ端にしてみるのも良いかも！」=“They all sound like fun, maybe we should try one end of the spectrum!”
「海で遊べるレジャーのことをどう思う？」=“What do you think of all the leisure activities we can do in the ocean?”
「せっかく南の島にいるんだし、大本命だと思うよー」=“Since we're on a southern island, I think it's a great idea.”
「外で思いっきりレジャーを楽しめるなんて最高だなぁ」=“It's so nice to be able to go out and enjoy leisure to the fullest.”

「ここって、海以外のレジャーも充実してるよね」=“There are a lot of leisure activities here besides the ocean.”
「ねー。色々遊べて、すっごく楽しいよー！」=“I'm not. We can play around a lot, and it's a lot of fun!”
「暑い日は、水遊びとかすごく気持ち良さそうだよね」=“On a hot day, playing in the water sounds really nice.”
「水際にいるだけで涼しいからねー。さすが、南の島だよねっ」=“It's cooler just being at the water's edge. That's what you get on the South Island.”

「自然も多いし、空気がすごく美味しくて元気が出てくるね」=“There's a lot of nature, and the air is so delicious and invigorating.”
「空気も美味しいけど、もしかしたら不思議な力でもあるのかな？」=“The air tastes good, too, but maybe it has some magical powers?”
「綺麗な空を眺めていたら、吸い込まれそうになる気がしない？」=“Don't you feel like you're being sucked in when you look at that beautiful sky?”
「私は、吸い込まれるよりも普通に目を奪われちゃうかも」=“I'm usually more transfixed than absorbed.”

「でも、南の島は可愛い生き物も多いし、逆に楽しいかもよ？」=“But there are so many cute creatures in the South Island, it might be fun to go the other way, you know?”
「熱帯魚って、冷たい北の海に連れて行ったらどうなるんだろ？」=“I wonder what happens to tropical fish when you take them to the cold northern sea?”
