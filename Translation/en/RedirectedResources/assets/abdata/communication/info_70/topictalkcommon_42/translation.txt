「海に山に……たくさんレジャーがあって悩んじゃうね」=“The sea, the mountains... there's so much to see and so much to do, it's hard to know where to start, isn't it?”
「どれも楽しそうだし、片っ端にしてみるのも良いかも！」=“Everything looks so fun too, it might be nice to just do everything one by one too!”
「海で遊べるレジャーのことをどう思う？」=“What do you think of playing around in the sea?”
「せっかく南の島にいるんだし、大本命だと思うよー」=“We're on a southern island afterall, it'd be a waste not to base all our activities around the wide open sea!”
「外で思いっきりレジャーを楽しめるなんて最高だなぁ」=“It's just the best being able to enjoy ourselves outside everyday without any worries, isn't it~”
「うんうん。私も南の島の良いところ、いっぱい満喫したいなー」=“Yepyep. I wanna have my fill of all the nice parts of this islands too~”
「ここって、海以外のレジャーも充実してるよね」=“This place is pretty rounded out, isn't it? There's so much more to see and do than just the sea.”
「ねー。色々遊べて、すっごく楽しいよー！」=“Isn't it though~. It's so fun, trying out all these things~!”
「暑い日は、水遊びとかすごく気持ち良さそうだよね」=“Playing around in the water sounds super nice on hot days, doesn't it?”
「水際にいるだけで涼しいからねー。さすが、南の島だよねっ」=“Just walking along the coastline by itself is so refreshing too~. I guess that's a southern island for you--”
「レジャーが多すぎて、うっかり遊びすぎちゃいそうだよ……」=“There's so many things to do, it's almost easy to forget the time and just keep messing around...”
「私も……研修旅行だし、遊んでばかりいられないもんね～」=“Same here... It's a study tour so, we gotta get some studying in too, don't we~”
「この島って、色んな動物や植物がいるよね」=“This island's got a whole lot of unique flora and fauna, doesn't it?”
「うん。歩いているだけで色々発見できて楽しいよねー」=“Yep. You can see so much just by walking around, it's a lot of fun, isn't it~?”
「南の島の生き物って、結構独特な進化したのもいるよね」=“Between all the fauna on this island, there's a bunch that had a pretty unique evolutionary path too, aren't there?”
「島の固有の名前がついたり、ここにしかいない種もいたりするしねー」=“Yeah, there's a lot with the island's name too, and many you can't find elsewhere at all~”
「この島で出会える景色って、どこもかしこもすごい綺麗だよね」=“Between all the sights to see on this island, just about every single one is beautiful, aren't they?”
「うん、いつまでも見ていたいなーって思わされちゃうもんね」=“Yep, you just can't help but want to look at them forever, can you?”
「この島にしかなさそうなものとか、いろいろ見て回りたいな」=“Man, I'd like to go around and see everything unique to this island atleast once.”
「毎日島中を探検しても、なかなか全部見て回れなさそうだよ」=“Even if we set out everyday to do that, I don't think we'd be able to see it all.”
「自然も多いし、空気がすごく美味しくて元気が出てくるね」=“There's so much greenery around, and the air's so tasty you just can't help but get energized, can you?”
「空気も美味しいけど、もしかしたら不思議な力でもあるのかな？」=“The air is very tasty but, it might also be some hidden power on this island, maybe?”
「綺麗な空を眺めていたら、吸い込まれそうになる気がしない？」=“Doesn't looking at this beautiful sky make you feel like it's just gonna suck you in?”
「私は、吸い込まれるよりも普通に目を奪われちゃうかも」=“For me, I think it's less being sucked in and more just having my eyes stolen.”
「海の生き物って、陸の生き物より不思議だよね」=“The life in the sea is way more interesting than land life, isn't it?”
「変わった生態だったり、見た目だったりで面白いよねー」=“Their ecology is so varied, and their appearances too, it's all so interesting~”
「海の中で見る光景ってすごく綺麗なんだろうな」=“I bet the view from inside the ocean is something else entirely.”
「サンゴ礁とかお魚とか……水面から差し込む光も綺麗だと思うよ！」=“Coral reefs, and schools of fishes going around... I think the way the light penetrates the water surface is really pretty too!”
「砂浜って、裸足で歩くとちょっと怖いよね」=“The idea of walking on the shore barefoot is kinda scary, isn't it?”
「それ、わかるかも。硬い物とか踏んじゃうと危ないもん」=“I can see that. You never know if you might step on something hard or sharp.”
「南の島なだけあって、日差しが強い日は砂浜も熱くなるよね」=“Since it's a southern island, the hot sunny days don't exactly leave the sand very cool to walk on, do they?”
「うん、砂浜でお料理もできそうだよね。お湯くらいならすぐに沸きそうかもー」=“Yep, bet you could even cook food on there. There's probably enough heat stored to heat up a whole bath too~”
「海や砂浜から急に生き物が飛び出して来たら驚くよね」=“If some sorta creature popped out of the sand or the sea out of nowhere, it'd probably cause a whole fuss, no?”
「でも、南の島は可愛い生き物も多いし、逆に楽しいかもよ？」=“But, there's so many cute animals and whatnot too here so, it might actually be pretty fun, you know?”
「熱帯魚って、冷たい北の海に連れて行ったらどうなるんだろ？」=“If you took the tropical fish from here and put them in the cold waters of the north, I wonder what'd happen?”
「どうなんだろうー？　意外と平気だったりするのかなー？」=“Who knows~? Maybe they'd be just fine in it~?”
「南の島ってこともあって、食べ物や飲み物も独特な風味だよね」=“With this being a southern island and all, the food and the drinks all have a unique taste to them, don't they?”
「そうだねー。酸っぱかったり辛かったりで食欲が増すよね！」=“Yeah~. There's so many spicy and sour things, you just can't help but get hungry!”
「買ったお菓子って、すぐに開けちゃうことってあるよね」=“When you buy a box of sweets here, sometimes you just can't help but open it and get at it right away, you know?”
「うんうん、美味しそうだから、つい食べちゃうよね－」=“Yepyep, it all looks so good, it's hard to not do it~”
「うーん、ここの飲食物は好き嫌いが大きそうな気がする」=“Nnnn, the way the food here is, I feel like you either like it or you really really don't.”
「私は好きなものばっかりだけど、苦手な人はダメそうだよね……」=“Personally, I love it all here but, for someone whose palate it doesn't fit...”
「ここら辺で買い物するなら、南の島でしか買えない物を選びたいよね」=“If you were to actually go out shopping here, it's hard to not just pick up stuff local to this place, isn't it?”
「ここでしか買えないものかー。いろいろありそうだし、じっくり選びたいな」=“Stuff local to this place, huh~? There's so much of it, I'd love to take my time with it all.”
「女の子が好きそうなものとかも結構売ってるよねー」=“They also sell a lot of stuff catering to a girl's tastes, don't they~?”
「可愛かったり、綺麗だったり、本当に目移りしちゃうよねっ」=“It's all so cute, so pretty, it's hard to take my eyes off it all--”
「ご当地物って、本当にいろんな種類があるよね……」=“They've got a whole variety of local products here, don't they...”
「その土地の特色が出てて、見て回るだけで楽しいよね～」=“With how much of the style of the region is evident in the products itself, it's fun to just window shop all day, isn't it~”
「普段と違う土地に来ると、エッチなことも開放的になるよね……」=“Coming to a whole different place like this, makes you feel a lot more liberal when it comes to lewd stuff, doesn't it...”
「う、うん、わかるかも……。私も、ちょっとそんな感じだし」=“Y-Yep, I can see that... I feel a bit of that, too.”
「[H名]とは何度でもエッチをしたい気分になるよ」=“I just can't help but want to have sex with you again and again, [H].”
「も、もぉ、何言ってるのー？　あんまり変なこと言っちゃダメだよぉ……？」=“J-Jeez, what are you saying~? You shouldn't say weird stuff out loud like that, okay~...?”
「[H名]とエッチしているときって、すごく幸せな時間だよ」=“The time we spend having sex is pure bliss to me, [H].”
「そう……なんだ。それは……うん、なんだか嬉しいかも……」=“I... see. That... yep, that makes me kinda happy...”
「エッチなお話したいの？　でも、私は別のお話の方が良いかなー」=“You wanna talk about lewd stuff? I'd rather we talked about something else~”
「そんな話題を振るなんて、キミってエッチなことが大好きだねー？」=“Bringing up something like that~, you really do love lewd stuff, don't you~?”
