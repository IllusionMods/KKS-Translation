「ホエールウォッチングとかって興味ある？」=“Got any interest in whale watching and whatnot?”
「むぅ、クジラとは流石に戦えないぞ。あの大きさはそれだけで脅威だ」=“Muh, even I cannot take on a whale. They are simply in a different weight class.”
「いや……戦うんじゃなくて見るだけだよ？」=“No... I meant just watching, you know? No fighting.”
「そ、それもそうか……すまない、少々野蛮なことを言ってしまった」=“I-I suppose simply watching is viable too... apologies, I must have seemed quite the savage there.”
「はは、でもクジラと戦ってるとこをウォッチングするのも楽しそうだったかも」=“Hahah. But, watching you take on a whale might have been fun in its own right.”
「こらこら、変に合わせなくていい。クジラとは平和に共存するのが一番だ」=“Come now, you really do not need to try and cover for me. Coexisting peacefully with a being like that is the best option.”
「ヤシガニって大きいのだと１メートルくらいになるらしいね」=“Seems like coconut crabs can go as big as a whole meter.”
「そこまで巨大だと、少々近寄りがたいものがあるな……」=“When they're that big, it's a bit hard to get close to them, isn't it...”
「でも、可愛い顔してるよ。性格も大人しいみたいだし」=“But, they've got real cute faces. And they seem to be pretty docile animals too.”
「はは、貴殿は懐が深いな。そう言われると愛らしい顔をしているかもしれん」=“Hahah, you're quite the broad-minded man. They really might have lovely faces then, if you're saying so.”
「ヤシガニと仲良くなれそう？」=“You think you'd be able to get close to one?”
「どうだろうな。相棒として飼育できたら、かなり頼りになりそうだが」=“I wonder. It'd likely make for quite the reliable partner, if raised as such though.”
「それいいね。無敵のコンビになりそう」=“That sounds nice. You'd make for an unbeatable pair.”
「月桃って薬にもなるらしいよ。凄いよね」=“Apparently shell gingers can be made into medicine too. It's amazing, isn't it?”
「ほう、薬草の類だったのか。それはいざというとき使えそうだな」=“Hoh, a medicinal herb, is it? Sounds like they could be quite useful in the right situation.”
「他にも、アロマオイルになったり、虫よけ効果もあるとか」=“You can also extract aroma oil from them, or make insect repellent and whatnot.”
「万能だな。島にたくさん植えられているのも頷ける」=“Quite the all purpose plant. I can certainly see why they're planted all over the island.”
「花も綺麗だし、一石何鳥か分からないね」=“The flowers are real pretty too, truly one stone many birds.”
「本当に優れたものは機能と美を共に備えるものだ。我等も見習わねばな」=“The truly excellent things in life are rich in both form and function. We ought to learn from them as well.”
「ヤマネコって、やっぱり普通の猫より強いのかな？」=“You think wildcats would beat out regular cats in a fight?”
「野生だからな。少なくとも家で飼われている猫よりは強いのではないか？」=“They're wild creatures, so I can see it. At the very least, they'd likely win against a regular housecat, no?”
「じゃあ懐かせるのは無理かな？　この前それっぽい猫を見たんだけど……」=“Then I guess taming one would be impossible too? I saw one that looked just like one the other day...”
「餌付けくらいはできるかもしれないが、懐くまでは難しいだろうな」=“I imagine you could get it used to eating in your presence but, taming one would be a much more difficult task.”
「ダメかぁ……ヤマネコと仲良くなりたかったなぁ……」=“Yeah... I really wanted to get close to one though...”
「それなら、貴殿がヤマネコより強いと見せつけてやれば従うかもしれないぞ？」=“In that case, if you can show it that you're stronger then it might yield, you know?”
「強いってどうやって見せつけるの？　まさか戦ったりしないよね？」=“How can I do that? You're not suggesting picking a fight with one, right?”
「簡単だ。睨み合って引かなければいい」=“It's simple. You glare at it, and make it be the one to look away.”
「えぇっ、そんなことしたら飛びかかってくるよ！？」=“Eeh--, it's gonna end up charging at me if I do that, you know!?”
「いや、大丈夫だ。野生の獣であれば相手の力量を見誤ることは無い」=“No, it'll be alright. Wild beasts never misjudge strength, they simply cannot.”
「それ、俺は絶対襲われそうだから……やっぱ遠くから眺めるくらいにしておく」=“I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get assaulted either way so... I'll just appreciate them from afar after all.”
「男が流れ星にお願いとかしたらみっともないかな？」=“Would it be disgraceful for a man to wish upon a shooting star?”
「いや、そうは思わないぞ。願い事に男女は関係ないからな」=“No, I do not think so. Wishes have no relation to one's gender.”
「よかった。この軟弱者！　みたいに言われるかと思ってた」=“Great. I thought you'd go "You sissy!" and whatnot.”
「む、我はそんな堅物に見られていたのか？」=“Muh, you see me as that much of a moralistic square?”
「堅物って言うか、少し古風な考えかなぁって……」=“Not a square so much as, someone a bit old-fashioned, and stuff...”
「まぁ、否定はできないな。だが我だって、流れ星に願うこともあるのだぞ？」=“Well, I cannot deny that. However, even I have wished upon such stars before, you know?”
「えっ、何をお願いしたの？」=“Eh--, what did you wish for?”
「秘密だ。言ったら叶わなくなるというのが、願い事の通説だからな」=“That's a secret. It's generally thought that wishes do not come true, if they're revealed to others.”
「えー、俺も言うからさー」=“Eh~, I'll tell you mine too~”
「尚更ダメだ。貴殿の願い事まで叶わなくなるぞ？　いいか、絶対言うなよ？」=“That would be even worse. Even your wish will end up not coming true, you know? Listen to me, do not tell it to anyone, alright?”
「なんかフリにも聞こえるけど……分かった、黙っておくよ」=“I dunno, feels like more of a pretense than something that'll actually happen... but okay, I'll keep quiet about it.”
「サガリバナって夜にしか咲かないんだって。なんか幻想的だよね」=“Apparently, mango pines only bloom at night. Feels a bit fantastical, doesn't it?”
「まるで花火のような花だな。色も形も、なによりその儚さが似ている」=“Almost similar to fireworks, aren't they? Both their color and their shape, not to mention their fleeting nature.”
「昼になると花は散っちゃうらしいからね。ほんと花火みたい」=“Yeah, especially since they die once dawn hits. They really are like fireworks.”
「一夜で散ってしまうのは残念だな……」=“A shame that they only last a night...”
「でも、すぐにつぼみができて、次の日には普通に咲くみたいだよ」=“But, apparently the buds grow back in no time, and bloom the next night like normal.”
「なんと、儚く見えて本当はたくましい花だったのか」=“What, they're truly quite the robust plants, aren't they? Even though they look so fleeting from a surface glance.”
「まるでどこかの誰かさんみたいだね」=“Almost like a certain someone, yeah.”
「こら、からかうのはよせ。我に儚い要素など無いだろう」=“Hey, no teasing. I do not have any such fleetingness to myself, do I?”
「いや、たまにボーっと遠くを見てる時とか……儚くて綺麗だなーって思うよ」=“No, sometimes when you just stare off in the distance... you really do look beautiful and fleeting.”
「むぅ……話をサガリバナに戻すんだ。我の話はもういい……」=“Muh... We are going back to talking about the flowers. No more about me...”
「ちょっと前に鳥の卵を見つけてさ、見守ってたら雛が孵ったんだ」=“The other day, I found these bird eggs. I started watching over them, and before I knew it they hatched.”
「ほう、それはさぞ感動的な体験だっただろう。我も一緒に見たかったな……」=“Hoh, I imagine that was quite the moving experience. I wish I could have seen it with you...”
「それで、孵った後はどうなったのだ？　無事に育っているのか？」=“So then, what happened to them? Are they growing up well?”
「元気にしてると思うよ。親鳥もちゃんといたし」=“I think so. The mama bird was right there with them too.”
「思う、なのか？　むぅ、心配だ……巣の場所を教えてくれ。我が直接守護しよう」=“You "think"? Muh, now I'm worried... tell me the location of the next. I shall safeguard them personally.”
「いや、あとは親鳥に任せておいた方が……」=“No, I think we'd better leave them be, leave it to their mama...”
「それでもしものことがあったらどうする！　せめて巣立ちまでは見守らねば……」=“But what if something happens!? We must look after them, atleast until they leave the nest...”
「えっと、あんまり人が関わるのもよくないと思うんだよね？　一応、野生の鳥だし……」=“Erhm, I don't really think anything good's gonna come of them getting too used to people, you know? I mean, they are wild birds so...”
「それは……貴殿の言う通りだが……心配だな、とても心配だ」=“That's... it is as you say, however... I am worried, very worried.”
「アサガオに水をやってたんだけど、この前ついに咲いてくれたんだ」=“I've been watering this morning glory for a bit and, it finally flowered the other day.”
「おお、それは良かったな。文字通り、貴殿の努力が花咲いたわけだ」=“Ooh, that's nice. Your efforts have truly bloomed into quite the nice thing.”
「はは、努力って言えるほどのことはしてないけどね」=“Hahah, it wasn't really to the point of "effort" though.”
「いや、何であれ成し遂げるというのは大変なことだ。貴殿は自分を誇っていい」=“No, achieving something takes real effort, no matter what it is. You ought to be proud.”
「そうかな？　そこまで言ってもらえるとちょっと嬉しいかも」=“You think so? That does kinda make me happy, that you see it that way.”
「しかし、貴殿に園芸の趣味があったとは……少々予想外だったな」=“However, to think you had a soft spot for gardening... I will admit, I did not expect that.”
「別に趣味ってわけじゃないけど、なんか気になっちゃってね」=“It's not like a hobby or anything, I just felt like doing it, you know? Especially since it looked pretty dry.”
「その優しさは大事にしてくれ。貴殿を良き道に導く指針に、きっとなる筈だ」=“Treasure that kind spirit of yours. It will lead you to good things, I guarantee it.”
「いや……俺はそんな大層な人間じゃないから……」=“Seriously... you're overestimating me a bit much...”
「はは、照れているのか？　顔を真っ赤にして……貴殿も花に劣らず可愛いな」=“Hahah, are you blushing there? Your face is rosey red... truly, as adorable as one too.”
「マンタって、あれだけ大きかったら乗れそうだよね」=“With how big mantas are, bet you could ride them, no?”
「ああ、乗れるぞ」=“Aah, you can.”
「え……乗ったこと……あるの？」=“Eh... have you... done it?”
「感覚は馬と同じだな。気性が穏やかなものであれば、比較的簡単に乗れる」=“One feels about the same as a horse. And if it has a docile disposition, you can ride one quite easily.”
「そ、そうなんだ……」=“I-I see...”
「手懐けるのは難しいが、海では頼りになる。短時間だが空も飛べるしな」=“It's quite hard to tame one but, they make for quite the reliable steeds on the sea. And they can fly for a bit as well.”
「飛ぶっていうかジャンプするんだよね？　俺の知ってるマンタと違わないよね？」=“You mean they jump, right? You sure we're talking about the same things?”
「海ほたるの光って綺麗だよね。正にファンタジーの世界って感じ」=“Sea fireflies have a really pretty glow to them, don't they? They truly make you feel like you've entered a fantasy world.”
「そうだな……最初に見た時は魔力を放出しているのかと驚いた」=“Indeed... At first I seriously thought they were charging up their mana.”
「いや……モンスターとかじゃないからそこは安心していいと思うよ」=“No... they're not monsters so I don't think you have to worry about them.”
「分からないぞ？　ああいうスライム系は形態変化が得意だ。擬態しているかもしれん」=“You never know, you know? Such slime-like beings are quite good at shapeshifting, it could have been simple mimicry.”
「スライムっぽいのがスライムの擬態してたら意味なくない？」=“Would a slime-like thing really mimic a slime though? Wouldn't that be kinda pointless?”
「確かに……我の考え過ぎか。貴殿はなかなか鋭い思考をもっているようだな」=“You have a point... I suppose I overthought. I see you've quite the sharp mind on you.”
「ウミガメって可愛いよね」=“Sea turtles are pretty cute, aren't they?”
「ああ、大人しい性格だしな。人懐こくて海で泳いでると近付いてくるらしいぞ」=“Aah, and very docile too. Seems they're quite the amiable creatures too, as they're known to swim up to you if you're out in the sea.”
「いいなぁ、ウミガメと一緒に泳げたら楽しいだろうねぇ……」=“Must be nice~, it'd probably be real fun to swim alongside a sea turtle~...”
「でも、俺が見たのは陸に上がってきてたウミガメだったんだよね」=“But, the one I saw had come up onto land, you know?”
「そうか、産卵でもしに来ていたのかもしれないな」=“I see, it may have come to lay eggs, perhaps.”
「たぶんそうだね。じゃなきゃわざわざ海から出てこないだろうし」=“Probably. Else it wouldn't go out of its way to come to shore.”
「自分が不利になる場所まで行って卵を産むのだから……母は強しだな」=“They come all the way to a location disadvantageous to them, just to lay eggs... a mother truly is strong.”
「なんか、助けてあげれば良かったかな？　持ち上げて運んであげるとか」=“Should I have like, helped it out? Like carry it further inward onto land or whatever.”
「いや、怪我でもしていなければ見守るのが正解だろう」=“No, as long as it is not injured, I imagine just watching over it would normally be the best course.”
「そっか、逆に邪魔になっちゃうもんね」=“I see, I can see myself getting in its way for sure, yeah.”
「誰でも慣れない場所にいる時は緊張しているからな。そっとしてもらえる方がありがたいこともある」=“Everyone gets nervous when they're in an unfamiliar place. It'd likely appreciate simply being left alone more.”
「星の砂って実は生き物の死骸なんだって。知ってた？」=“Apparently starsand is actually just dead remains of living things. Did you know that?”
「なんと、砂ではなく死骸だったのか。では死霊術などと相性が良いかもしれないな」=“What, not sand but rather corpses? Perhaps it might make a good medium for necromancy then.”
「えっ、そうかもしれないけど……星の砂が生き返って襲ってくるとか、ちょっとシュールだね」=“Eh--, maybe but... starsand coming back to live and assaulting people, sounds kinda surreal.”
「はは、それは言えている。だがしかし生き返っても所詮は小粒だから案ずるな。集団で迫られると少々脅威かもしれないが……」=“Hahah, indeed. However, even if they do, they are but small fry, so do not worry. If they bunch up and attack as a mass however...”
「うわ……それはちょっと怖いかも」=“Uwah... that might be a bit scary.”
「なに、ただの例え話だ。土産屋に行って、星の砂を怖がったりするんじゃないぞ？」=“It's naught but an example. Do not go getting scared of starsand at a souvenir shop, alright?”
「ウムイの鐘って名前がいいよね。いかにもこの島の名物って感じ」=“The Bell of Umuy has a really nice name, doesn't it? It fits just right in, in this place.”
「名は体を表すと言うからな。恋愛の名所であれば、尚更重要だろう」=“They do say that one's name tells of one's nature, after all. I imagine that's all the more important, when it's a tourist spot for romance.”
「ただ『愛の鐘』とか言われたら、よくあるーって感じになっちゃうもんね」=“It would sound pretty commonplace if they just called it "The Bell of Love", for sure.”
「はは、それでも人は来るだろうがな。それだけ愛は人を引き付ける」=“Hahah, I imagine people would still come, regardless. That's just how much of a pull love has on people.”
「『モテモテの鐘』とかに名前を変えたら、男ばっかり来そうだけどね」=“Bet it'd only be popular with guys though, if they renamed it to something like "The Bell of Sex Appeal”
「馬鹿者、そんな罰当たりな話をしていると……愛の精霊に怒られるぞ？」=“You moron, if you say such accursed things... the spirits of love will curse you, you know?”
「女子っておっぱいへの視線に敏感って言うけど……あれほんと？」=“They say that girls are sensitive to gazes towards their chests... is that true?”
「ああ。我だって、貴殿のいやらしい視線も見て見ぬフリをしているだけなのだからな」=“Aah. Even I simply pretend to not notice your indecent gazes, for the record.”
「やっぱりそうなんだ……じゃあ、視線だけで感じちゃうとかもあったりする？」=“I knew it... then, can you feel pleasure from just a gaze too?”
「んなっ、胸の話は終わりだ……変に掘り下げようとするな」=“Wwha--, no more of this topic... do not try to dig any further about such strange things.”
「もしかして……女子が見て見ぬフリをしてくれてるのって、見られて気持ちいいから？」=“By any chance... do girls pretend to not notice, because it feels nice?”
「だーかーら！　胸の話は終わりだと言っただろう！　わ、我は何も答えないからな！」=“I - told - you! No more of that topic! Y-You will not get any answers out of me!”
「女子にも当然、フェチってあるよね？」=“Girls have fetishes too, right?”
「まぁ……大なり小なりはあるだろう。男子ほど細かくは無いと思うがな……」=“Well... more or less, I imagine. Ours are likely not as detailed as a man's though...”
「大なり小なりって……アソコの大きさのこと？」=“More or less... does the more refer to the size?”
「ちがうっ！　貴殿、分かっててとぼけているな？　趣味が悪いぞ……」=“No--! You know that's not what I meant, don't you? Yet you still...”
「でも男子は巨乳派と貧乳派でよく争ったりするよ？　だから女子も同じかなって」=“I mean, boys argue a lot, almost fight, over breast size, you know? So I was just wondering if girls are the same.”
「そんな不毛な争い……あ、待て、その顔をやめろ。不毛というのはそういう話ではないからな？」=“Such infertile arguments... ah, wait, stop making that face. I did not mean it that way when I said "infertile", alright?”
「女子が欲求不満になるのってどんな時？」=“What sort of thing makes girls sexual frustrated?”
「どうだろうな……一般的には疲れると性欲が上がると言われているが……」=“I wonder... generally, most women do say that they feel it when they get tired, but...”
「じゃあ……剣の鍛錬とかした後って、そのまま柄で……」=“Then... after you're done training with your sword, do you like, with the handle, I mean...”
「ばっ、馬鹿者っ！　剣は神聖なものなのだぞ？　そ、そんな卑猥なことに使うわけないだろう！」=“M--, Moron--! Swords are sacred, you know? D-Do you truly think I could use one for such an indecent act!?”
「ほんとに？　なんかそこまで強く否定されると逆に怪しいような……」=“You sure? You're denying it so strongly, it almost feels suspicious...”
「それは貴殿はそうあって欲しいと思っているからだ……まったく、変態妄想も程々にしておけよ？」=“That's only because you wish it to be that way... good grief, keep such perversions under control as well, alright?”
「初めてエッチした時の感想……聞いていい？」=“Mind if I ask... about our first time together?”
「なに？　いきなりどうした？　感想も何も……あの時はあまり余裕がなくてだな……」=“What? What is it so suddenly? Our first time... frankly, I did not have much room to mull on it at the time...”
「はは、俺も同じだったよ。だから、なんか変なことしてなかったか気になっちゃって……」=“Hahah, it was the same for me. So I started wondering if I did something weird then, or what...”
「別に変なことはしていなかったと思うぞ？　まぁ正直、何が変かもあの時は分かっていなかったが……」=“Personally, I do not think so, you know? Well, to be fair, at the time I did not know what was normal and what was strange...”
「特別なことだというのは強く感じたな。あと、やはり少し痛みもあったが、そこまでではなかった」=“I did feel very strongly that it was a very special time. Also, there was a bit of pain after all, however it was not as severe as I thought it'd be.”
「痛みと気持ちよさを同時に味わうなんて中々無い……そういう意味でも初めては特別なのだろうな」=“Feeling pain and pleasure at the same time is not something you can experience everyday... in that sense as well, it was certainly a special time.”
「そっか、よかったぁ……俺、ちゃんとできてたみたいだね」=“I see, thank god... seems like I did a proper job then.”
「ああ、何も案ずることはない。貴殿は我を女にしてくれた男だぞ？　もっと胸を張るがいい」=“Aah, you have nothing to worry about. You are the man who made a woman out of me, you know? Hold your head high.”
