「この島、いろんなレジャーがあって迷っちゃうね」=“There's so many things to do on this island, it's hard to make up your mind, isn't it?”
「もういっそのことサイコロ振って決めてええかもしらんね」=“At this point just rolling a dice to decide might be fine too.”
「得意なレジャー、苦手なレジャーってある？」=“Got any sort of activities that you like, or don't like?”
「全部得意やで！！　っていいたいねんけどなぁ……でもどれも好きやで」=“I like 'em all!! is what I'd like to say but well~... but I do like them all.”
「身体を動かすレジャーが多いね」=“There's a whole lot of activities that involve moving around, aren't there?”
「楽しいねんけど、汗ビチャになるんが難点やなぁ」=“They're fun but, I really dun like gettin' all sweaty, ya know~?”
「色々楽しむためにも、ペース配分を考えなきゃね」=“We gotta learn to pace ourselves, don't we? So that we don't burn out on it all.”
「いやぁ、全力で行こうや。悔いを残したないしな」=“Nah~, let's just go all out. I dun wanna go home with regrets.”
「レジャーは、やっぱ一人じゃなく二人で遊ばないとね」=“You really gotta do the activities here together with someone, you know?”
「せやね……一人レジャーは寂しすぎるもんな」=“Yeah... it gets way too lonely doin' them alone.”
「この島で遊ぶなら、やっぱり海のレジャーがいいね」=“If we're gonna do stuff here, we might as well do water acitivities, huh?”
「せやな。ただ泳ぐだけやと勿体ないわ」=“Yeah. Just swimmin' aroun' would be a waste of it all.”
「生の動物や、植物に触れることって、大切だと思うんだ」=“I think coming in contact with all this wildlife and all this greenery is very precious for us.”
「なんか生命力感じるよな～。見てるだけで癒やし感じるわ～」=“Ya can really feel life from it all, can'tcha~? Just lookin' at it makes me feel soothed~”
「この暑い中、草木や動物も生きているんだね」=“All those animals and all this vegetation is living in this heat, just like us, isn't it?”
「適応してんのかな。それともアッツイの我慢してんのかな？」=“Did they adapt? Or are they just endurin' the harsh heat here?”
「この島は空気が綺麗だから、目に写る自然が鮮やかに感じるね」=“With how clean the air is here, all the nature feels extra vivid, doesn't it?”
「ウチも色鮮やかやろ？　キラッキラしとるやろ？　……してへんか」=“I look extra vivid too, no? I'm sparklin' too, no? ...I ain't, huh?”
「大いなる自然って、なんだか清らかで、聖なるモノって感じがしない？」=“The great nature around us, doesn't it look extra pure and just, holy?”
「スピリチュアルは苦手やけど……なんかそーいうのある気ぃするわ」=“I ain't really much for that sorta spiritual stuff but... I do feel like there's a bit of that~.”
「広大な自然の中にいると、寝っ転がりたくならない？」=“Doesn't being within all this nature just make you wanna take a nap on the ground?”
「なるなる！　いや、でもウチらもう大人やし……ホンマにやったらアカンで」=“It does, it does! No but, we're already adults so... we can't actually do that.”
「綺麗な自然の景色を前にすると、美しさに感動しちゃうよね」=“With such beautiful sights in front of us all the time, it's almost a bit moving, isn't it?”
「……ウチに向けられたい言葉やな。まあ、大自然には勝たれへんけどやなぁ」=“...I almost wanna hear those words directed at myself. Well, I guess there's no winnin' against mother nature, is there~”
「この近海って、いろんな生き物がそこかしこにいるんだね」=“There's all sorts of life living around these waters, isn't there?”
「けったいなモンから、可愛いモノ……はたまた美味しいモンまで色々やね」=“From weird stuff, to cute stuff... to even delicious stuff, there's all sorts.”
「水中の世界って不思議だよね。陸とはぜんぜん違う」=“The world under the sea is really incredible, isn't it? It's completely different from land.”
「居心地ええんやろか？　ウチも水中で呼吸できたら住んでみたいわ」=“Is it comfortable in there? I wanna try livin' in there too, if only I could breathe underwater.”
「海って泳ぐだけじゃなく、眺める楽しみもあるんだね」=“The sea's not only fun to swim in, but also to gaze at, isn't it?”
「さすが母なる海やね。そういうたらな、ウチのオカンが──ってどうでもええか」=“That's the great mother sea for ya. Tell ya what actually, my moth--, eh who cares.”
「５億年前には、俺たちみんな海にいたんだね」=“5 hundred million years ago, we were all under the sea, weren't we?”
「うん、その頃の記憶、なんとなくあるわ～……って、冗談やで？」=“Yep, I can just about remember stuff from back then too, somehow~... wuh, I'm jokin', aight?”
「熱帯魚って、カラフルで可愛いよね」=“Tropical fishes are really colorful and cute, aren't they?”
「可愛いよなぁ……飼うてみたいなぁ……でも見てるだけで我慢しとこかぁ」=“They really are~... I wanna keep a few as pets~... But guess I'll satisfy myself just with lookin'~”
「海の生物って、どうしてそういう形になったのかよくわかんないことがあるよね」=“It's a bit hard to understand just how marine life ended up in the shape that it did, isn't it?”
「せやなぁ……けど、そういうこと考えるんは頭エエ人に任せた方がええわ」=“Yeah~... but, it'd be better to leave thinkin' about that sorta stuff to people with better heads than ours.”
「この島、美味しそうなものが色々あるけど、独特なものも多いよね」=“This island has a lot of tasty food but, a lot of it is also pretty darn unique, isn't it?”
「あー、クセ強いの、ちょいちょいあるよな。まあ、口にしたら結構イケる場合多いけど」=“Ah~, ya do come across that one peculiar dish or two every so often, don'tcha? Well, a lotta times they do taste pretty good though.”
「この島って、色々名産品が売られてるよね。目移りするなぁ」=“They sell a whole lotta local products on this island, don't they? It's hard not to get distracted~”
「買うんやったら、やっぱ思い出になるもんがええなぁ～」=“I'd wanna buy somethin' memorable if I was gonna buy somethin', ya know~?”
「この島の食べ物って南国の離島だけあって、味付けや食材に違いを感じるよね」=“Considering how split off this place is from the mainland, the flavouring and the ingredients they use for food is kinda real different, isn't it?”
「ちょっとクセあるけど、食べてみたらめっさ美味しいねんなぁ」=“It's a bit unique but, it's real good once ya actually get down ta eatin'~”
「この島……やっぱ独自の文化って感じだね」=“This island... it kinda has its own culture, doesn't it?”
「おかげで珍しいもんでいっぱいやもんな～。島の中、見て回ってるだけでおもろいわぁ」=“Thanks to that, it's full of new stuff we've never seen~. Just runnin' around and lookin' at stuff is fun~”
「名産品や民芸品って、見てるだけで楽しくなるよね」=“Just lookin' at local products or folk crafts and whatnot is fun on its own, isn't it?”
「せやなぁ、ウチ、そーいうのんが、旅行の醍醐味や思てんねん」=“Yeah~, personally, I think that sorta stuff is the real fun of travellin' around.”
「この島で売ってるものを買って帰って、友達に配りたいなぁ」=“I wanna buy the stuff they sell here and give some to all of my friends~”
「そうやねぇ……何買うてもめっちゃ喜んでくれるんちゃう？　知らんけど」=“Yeah~... won't they be happy no matter what ya buy? I mean, I dunno.”
「……こう暑いと、逆にスキンシップしたくならない？」=“...When it's this hot out, doesn't it actually make you wanna get up close and personal with others?”
「わかるようなわからんような……まあ、でも、そういうのもアリやで」=“I feel like I relate but at the same time not... well, but, I can see that for sure.”
「やっぱりさ……長続きする秘訣ってさ、エッチの相性なんじゃないかな？」=“So like... isn't the secret to a healthy long term relationship, really just sexual compatibility?”
「んー……んん～～……うん、めっちゃ考えたけど、それ反論でけへんわ……」=“Nn~... nnn~~... yep, I thought real hard about it just then and, I can't deny it...”
「[H名]とのエッチが楽しみだ……」=“I'm seriously looking forward to having sex again soon, [H]...”
「急にそーいうこと言うのナシやで？　だ、だって……恥ずかしいし……」=“Aight, ya ain't allowed to say that stuff outta nowhere, okay? I-I mean... it's real embarrassin'...”
「う、うん？　いや、それ、よーわからん……ごめんやで？」=“Y-Yeah? No, that's, I dun really get it... sorry, aight?”
「……ちょっとグイグイ来すぎちゃう？　もうちょっとマイルドなんがええなぁ」=“...Ain'tcha comin' a bit too hard here? Ya should really consider bein' a bit more mild~.”
