「時間があれば、ホエールウォッチングに行くのも良いかもね」=“It might be nice to go whale watching too, if we get the time.”
「それって、あのすごく大きなクジラを近くで見れるんだよね？」=“We can go look at a whale here? Even though they're so big?”
「運が良ければ、船のすぐ近くまで来てくれるかもしれないね」=“Yep, and if we get lucky, it might just decide to come up close to the boat too.”
「そっかぁ。実際に見てみたら、どんな感じなのかなー」=“I see~. I wonder what it's gonna feel like, to look at one in person~”
「私、感動して何も言えなくなっちゃうかも」=“I might get so emotional that words start failing me.”
「気持ちはわかるよ。俺も実際に見たらそうなりそうだしね」=“I feel you on that. Feels like I'm gonna end up the same way too.”
「ヤシガニって、器用に爪を使えるんだって」=“Apparently coconut crabs are very good at using their claws.”
「そうなの？　挟む力は強いって聞いたことあるけど」=“Really? I mean I've heard that their grip strength is pretty amazing.”
「穴を掘るだけじゃなくて、木に登ったりヤシの実に穴を開けたりするみたい」=“Yeah, but apparently they can even claw their way up trees and dig open holes in coconuts.”
「しかも、器用に中身をほじくって食べるって話だよ」=“And what's more, they can apparently even dig up the contents pretty well to eat them.”
「それはすごいね！　あんな手でそんなことできるんだ」=“That's amazing! They can use their claws like that, huh?”
「タイミングがあえば、ぜひともその瞬間を見てみたいなー」=“If we get the chance, I'd love to see them going at it for myself sometime~”
「[H名]は月桃って知ってる？」=“Do you know what a shell ginger is, [H名]?”
「もちろん！　独特な香りがあって、料理を包むのに使ってるよねー」=“Of course! They've got such a nice fragrance, they use the leaves to wrap up food, don't they~”
「この葉っぱで包んだお餅が、すっごく美味しいんだよ！」=“Apparently rice cakes wrapped in them taste really good!”
「へぇ、そうなんだ。それはちょっと興味あるかも」=“Heh, I didn't know that. It sounds pretty interesting.”
「じゅあ、今度一緒に食べてみようよ。絶対に気に入ると思うから！」=“Then, let's go try them together sometime. I'm sure you're gonna love them!”
「そうだね、食べに行くときはぜひとも声を掛けてね」=“Sure, give me a shout whenever you wanna go, okay?”
「この前、ヤマネコとバッタリ出くわしたんだよ」=“The other day, I actually happened upon a wildcat by chance.”
「へぇ、そうなんだ。やっぱり可愛かった？」=“Heh, I see. Was it cute?”
「可愛い……とは思うんだけど、なにぶん野生のだったから……」=“I mean... I guess it was but, a wildcat's a wildcat so...”
「あー……もしかして引っかかれた、とか？」=“Ah~... did it turn bad, or something?”
「それは大丈夫だった。でも、危機一髪だったかも」=“It didn't, thankfully. But it was touch and go for a bit there.”
「そっかぁ。私、できたらモフモフとかしたいんだけど……やっぱり無理かなー？」=“I see~. I'd wanna just stroke it and fluff it up but... I guess that's not gonna happen~?”
「ちょっと難しいかもね。よほど人に慣れていれば別だと思うけど……」=“Would be pretty difficult. I mean I do think if they got used to being around people, it'd probably turn out differently...”
「よーし、じゃあ見かけたらチャレンジしてみるよ！」=“Alright~, I'll try going for it if I come across one!”
「もしかしたら撫でるのを許してくれるかもしれないしねっ」=“It might lemme stroke its head, afterall--”
「流れ星で思い出したんだけど、いろんな伝承が世界中にあるみたいだね」=“Seeing a shooting star reminded me, there's all sorts of legends in the world, aren't there?”
「願いごとをすると、それが叶うって奴かな？」=“You mean stuff like how if you wish upon a shooting star, it'll come true?”
「それもそうだけど、もっと神話的なものとか……」=“That too but, I was talking about more mythical stuff...”
「それこそ、死を告げるとか天国の戸口だとか、そんなのかな？」=“You know, stuff like how a falling star denotes a death, or that the doors of heaven are open, stuff like that?”
「そうなんだ？　星が流れるって幻想的な光景だもんねー」=“Really? I mean I guess a shooting star is a very fantastical thing to see, it makes sense~”
「世界中の人たちも、きっとそこにいろんな物語を見たりしたのかな」=“The people around the world probably saw all sorts of things in it, worth fashioning legends out of.”
「そうだね。そう考えると、流れ星ってロマンチックだよね」=“Probably. Thinking about it like that, it makes shooting stars seem very romantic, doesn't it?”
「うんっ。そういう話を聞くだけで、すごいドキドキしちゃうねっ」=“Yep--. Just hearing about that sort of stuff makes your heart pound, you know--”
「夜に咲く、サガリバナって花を知ってるかな？」=“Do you know of the Mango pine, the flower that blooms at night?”
「翌朝には散っちゃうっていう花のことかな？」=“Do you mean the one withers by morning?”
「花びらは色鮮やかで、花火のように見えるって聞いたことあるよ」=“I've heard that the petals are so colorful, they look like fireworks.”
「うん。こういう儚い感じの花ってなんだか良いよね」=“Yep. Those sorts of fleeting and transient things are really nice, aren't they?”
「ついつい、夜歩くときに当たりを見渡して探しちゃうよ」=“I just can't help but keep an eye out for them whenever I'm out taking a walk at night.”
「わかるなー。私も、夜にしか見られないって思ったら絶対に探しちゃう」=“I feel that~. I'd probably do the same if I came to know of a flower I could only see at night.”
「そっか……。でも、あまり探し回って変な場所に行っちゃわないようにね」=“I see... But, be careful not to lose track of where you are and end up somewhere weird, okay?”
「ちゃんと足元を見て歩かないと、転んだりすることもあるだろうし」=“There's also the risk of tripping and hurting yourself, if you don't look where you walk.”
「あはは、心配性だなぁ。でも、ありがと。気をつけるねー」=“Ahahah, you're such a worrywart~. But, thanks. I'll be careful, okay~?”
「そういえば……ときどき鳥の巣を見守ってたんだけど、ようやく雛が孵ったんだよ」=“Reminds me... there's this birds nest that I check over anytime I get the chance, and just the other day it had a little chick hatch in it.”
「ええーっ、雛が？　すごいねー！」=“Eeeh~, a chick? That's amazing~!”
「やっぱり、産まれて間もない雛って小っちゃいのかな？」=“Is a newborn chick really tiny afterall~?”
「手のひらには簡単に乗せられそうなサイズではあったね」=“I can tell you that it was definitely small enough for me to carry around on my palm.”
「わぁ、可愛いー！　手のひらに乗せて撫で回したいなー」=“Wah, so cute~! I wanna let it ride on mine, and maybe stroke it~”
「可愛いけど、野生の生き物だからね。そっとしておいた方がいいと思うよ」=“They're definitely cute but, they're still wild, you know? I think it'd be best if we just left them alone.”
「そっかぁ……私の我儘で傷つけちゃったら、可哀そうだもんね。そっと見守るだけにするよ」=“I see~... I'd definitely feel bad, if I hurt it in my own selfishness. I'll just watch over them from afar, just like you do.”
「うん、それがいいと思うよ。今度どこで見れるか教えてあげるね」=“Yep, that'd be best. I'll show you where the nest is sometime, aight?”
「アサガオにずっと水をあげてたら、綺麗な花を咲かせたんだ」=“So, there's this morning glory I've been watering for a while, the other day it had a really pretty flower blooming on it.”
「あの花ってカラフルだけど、素朴な感じがしてすごく良いよね」=“Don't those sorts of flowers feel just nice to look at? So colorful yet simple.”
「それわかるなー。私もアサガオは好きだよ」=“I feel that~. I like morning glories too.”
「それに花言葉もすごく素敵なのが多いんだよね」=“Not to mention, there's all sorts of lovely words for it in flower language, you know?”
「そうなんだ？　さすがに花言葉までは知らないけど……どんなのがあるの？」=“Really? Can't say my depth of knowledge goes as far as the language of flowers... what sort of meanings does it have?”
「愛情とか結束……だったかな？」=“Love and, union... I think?”
「へぇ……確かに良い花言葉だね」=“Hoh... those really are some nice meanings.”
「他にも、色で違う花言葉も付けられてたよ。どんな花言葉だったかは……忘れちゃったけど」=“There were also meanings, depending on the color of the flower. What were they again... I can't remember.”
「マンタってデカいよね……」=“Mantas are huge, aren't they...”
「うん。大きいっていうのは知ってたけど、実際に見たらすごい迫力だよね」=“Yep. I mean, I always knew they were "big" but seeing one in person hits different, doesn't it?”
「しかも、海面から飛び出てグワーって飛んで来たりもするみたいだし……」=“Not to mention, they even tend to leap out of the sea sometimes, apparently...”
「それはすごい迫力だね……！」=“That stuff's so overwhelming, isn't it...!”
「目の前で見たら、怖くて泣いちゃうかも？」=“If one did it in front of my eyes, I think I might cry?”
「ははっ、まずそんなことは無いだろうけど、否定できないなぁ……」=“Haha--, that probably won't happen, but I can't say it's a sure thing~...”
「海って、海ほたるみたいに海面の色が変わったりする現象が結構あるよね？」=“The color of the sea tends to change a lot, doesn't it? Just like sea fireflies.”
「ん？　それってどういうこと？」=“Nn? What do you mean?”
「ほら、赤潮とか、青潮とか……」=“You know, like a red tide, or a blue tide...”
「プランクトンで色が変わるやつだねー」=“Ah, you mean how the color changes due to plankton, huh~?”
「海ほたるも、生き物がピカピカ光ってるんだし、似たようなもの……なのかな？」=“Sea fireflies are also, just living things that shine brightly so, it's similar to that... I guess?”
「ウミガメを見かけたんだけど、そのときにふと思ったんだ」=“I saw this sea turtle the other day, and a thought came to me.”
「なになに？　どんなことを思ったのー？」=“What was it~? What kinda thought~?”
「ウミガメって、食べられるんだよな……って」=“Sea turtles are edible, aren't they... and all.”
「えっ……？」=“Eh--...?”
「食べたことはないけど、どんな味がするんだろうなーなんて考えちゃって」=“It went about as far as me wondering what they taste like, since I've never eaten one.”
「た、食べちゃうの！？　あんなに可愛いのに！？」=“Y-You're gonna eat one?! Something so adorable!?”
「い、いや、俺が食べるってわけじゃなくて……」=“N-No, I didn't say I was gonna go and eat one...”
「そんなの可哀想だよ！　キミがそんな酷い人だったなんて……！」=“Don't, I'd feel bad! I can't believe you were such a horrible person this whole time...!”
「待って、ウミガメ料理があるって話をしたかっただけで、誤解だから！」=“Wait, I just wanted to talk about how there seems to be a whole style of cuisine around them, this is just a misunderstanding!”
「星の砂といえば、ここら辺の定番のお土産だよね」=“Star sand seems to be a really popular souvenir from these parts, doesn't it?”
「実際に可愛い形だし、人気があるのもわかるよねー」=“I mean, it has such a cute shape so, it's not hard to see why it's so popular~”
「でも、あんなにいっぱい売り出しててなくなったりしないのかな？」=“But, they sell so much of it, won't it all disappear?”
「勝手に取っていくのは禁止されてるし、ちゃんと調整してるんじゃないかな」=“Well, it's banned to just scoop it up and take it with you so, they must have strict rules surrounding its harvesting, no?”
「それなら良いけど……海岸が何もない空っぽにならないといいよねー」=“I hope they do... it'd be a sad day if the pretty beaches just disappeared~”
「ウムイの鐘みたいな名所って他にもあったりするのかな？」=“Do you think the bell of Umuy exists in other places as well?”
「細かいところはいろいろと違うと思うけど、日本中にあるみたいだよ？」=“I imagine the intricate details are probably different between each place but, there's quite a few of them all throughout Japan, you know?”
「やっぱり観光資源としては有用なのかな、恋が叶う……的なの」=“I guess something like "Your love will come true if you do this" is... pretty practical as far as tourist spots go.”
「そうかもねー。でも、違った見方をしてみればとても素敵なことだと思うんだ」=“You've got a point there~. But, taken from another viewpoint, I think it's a very lovely thing.”
「違う……って、例えば？」=“Another viewpoint... for example?”
「日本中のいろんな所で、カップルが出来てる……って考えるの。すごいと思わない？」=“Couples all over japan, are ringing the same bell... Don't you think that that's just wonderful?”
「確かに！　それはとても素敵なことだね」=“For sure! That does sound wonderful.”
「胸って、一般的には大きい方が良いと言われているよね」=“When it comes to busts, most people would agree that the bigger the better, right?”
「もー、エッチな話をするつもりなのー？」=“Jeez~, are we seriously talking about lewd stuff like that~?”
「そういうキミも、やっぱり大きい方が好きだったりするのかな？」=“I guess at the end of the day, you prefer bigger breasts too?”
「いや、俺はそこまで大小にはこだわりは無いよ」=“No, to me it doesn't really matter if they're all that big or small.”
「個人的には、大きさよりも形だし、さらに言えば感度が１番だと思ってるから」=“Personally, shape is more important to me. I would even go so far as to say that sensitivity is the most important.”
「ふーん。でも要するに、おっぱいは好きってことだよね。エッチっ」=“Hmmm. All those words just to say you do love boobs. You lewdie--”
「世の中には、どうして？　って思うようなフェティシズムがあるよね」=“In this world, there's even some fetishes that just make you go "Why even?" sometimes, aren't there?”
「話には聞いたことあるかなー。キミも何かあったりするの？」=“I've heard of some, I think~. Do you have one of those too?”
「いや、特には無いつもりだけど」=“No, I mean I'm certainly trying not to.”
「女の子の後ろ姿とか見てると、時々グッとくることが……」=“But sometimes, when I look at a girl from behind, my heart just...”
「……それは、立派なフェティシズムだと思うな」=“...That's one of those fetishes, alright.”
「もう、キミってば私のこともそういう目で見てたんだねー」=“Jeez, you've been looking at me with those sorts of eyes too, haven't you~?”
「やっぱり、[H名]も欲求不満になったりするのかな？」=“I guess you have times when you feel sexually frustrated too, [H名]?”
「と、突然なにを言い出すのー！？」=“W-What're you even saying~?!”
「なんとなく気になっちゃってさ。どうなのかなーって」=“I just got a bit curious, you know? Like, "does she though?" and whatnot.”
「そりゃあ、私だってそういう気分のときもあったりするけどぉ……」=“Well I mean, sometimes I get into that sort of a mood too~...”
「そのときはオナニーをして解消する？」=“Do you masturbate when you do? To get rid of it.”
「う、うん、まぁ……って、何を言わせるのー！？」=“Y-Yeah, well... wuh, what're you making me say~?!”
「やっぱり、女の子にとって初体験って特別なものなのかな？」=“I guess the first time's a special one for a girl?”
「それはもちろんだけど……。急にどうしてそんなこと聞くのー？」=“Of course but... why do you ask~?”
「男は最初の男になりたがるけど、女性は最後の女になりたがるって聞いてさ」=“Well, I'd heard that while men often want to be a woman's first, women often tend to want to be a guy's last, so.”
「へー、そんな話があるんだ？」=“Hoh, that's what they say?”
「うーん……でも、そんなのは人それぞれだと思うよー？」=“Nnnn... I'm pretty sure that sort of stuff depends upon the person, you know~?”
「初めての人はやっぱり特別……って女の子も多いと思うし」=“I'm pretty sure many girls out there think that... that the first person you do it with, is very special.”
「ちなみに、[H名]はどっちのタイプ？」=“Incidentally, which type are you, [H名]?”
「わ、私は……やっぱり、特別って思いたい……かな……？」=“I-I... I'd rather be that special someone myself... you know...?”
