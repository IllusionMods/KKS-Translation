「クジラは好き？　この近くの海でホエールウォッチングができるんだって」=“Do you like whales?　I heard you can go whale-watching in the ocean near here.”
「好きやで。なんか黒くてデッカイし」=“I love it. I like him. He's kind of black and big.”
「……小さなクジラもいるんじゃない？」=“I think there's even a ...... little whale out there.”
「いや、小さかったらクジラちゃうんちゃう？　それはもう別の魚やで」=“No, it's not a whale if it's small.　That's a different fish now.”
「クジラって、魚じゃないよ。哺乳類だよ」=“Whales are not fish. It's a mammal.”
「海で泳ぐものの総称として言うてん。まあええわ、こりゃぜひ実際のクジラを見んといかんなぁ」=“I say it as a general term for things that swim in the sea. Well, I'll have to see a whale in person.”
「うん、見られるといいね」=“Yeah, I hope you get to see it.”
「ヤシガニってデカいよね……」=“Palm crabs are huge. ......”
「せやねん……あれはアカン。取って食われるサイズや」=“I'm not going to let that one go. ...... That's not good. That's the size to be taken and eaten.”
「もし……あれが襲いかかってきたらどうしよう？」=“What if ...... that thing attacked us?”
「野生動物に立ち向かおう思たらアカン。逃げの一手やで」=“If you think you are going to confront a wild animal, you are wrong. It's a run-and-run move.”
「でも写真は取りたいよね……レアモンスターだし」=“But I'd love to get a picture ...... of it, it's a rare monster.”
「うん、希少動物やからね。腕一本失ってでも、エンカウントしたこと自慢できるで」=“Yes, they are rare animals. Even if you lose an arm, you can brag about your encounter with one.”
「……腕一本を犠牲にしなきゃいけないのかぁ。襲われないよう、注意しなきゃ」=“I wonder if I have to sacrifice one of my ...... arms. I have to be careful not to get attacked.”
「月桃って、なんか可愛い見た目してるよね」=“Gekko is kind of cute looking, isn't it?”
「あー、この島ん中で、よぉ見かけるあの花やろ？」=“Ah, you know, those flowers you see all over the island?”
「そうそう、アロマでも有名らしいよ」=“Oh yeah, I hear it's famous for its aroma.”
「なんかええ匂いしそうな見た目やしなぁ。味はどうなんやろ？　美味しいんかな？」=“It looks like it smells good. I wonder what it tastes like.　Is it good?”
「花だから、美味しくないんじゃない？」=“They're flowers, so they can't taste good, can they?”
「そーなんか……桃って名前に負けてへん？　それ」=“I don't know...it's kind of like being named after a peach .......　That.”
「見た目重視だから、仕方ないんじゃないかなぁ」=“I guess it's all about looks.”
「ヤマネコってさ、すっごく可愛いんだよ」=“Bobcats are so cute.”
「けど、野生のネコやしなぁ……触ったら、めっさ引っ掻いたり噛み付いたりしてきよるんやろな」=“But they're wild cats, and if you touch ...... them, they'll probably scratch and bite you really hard.”
「可愛いんだから、我慢しなきゃ！」=“He's so cute, we have to put up with him!”
「おお～～、愛情、ヤバいな……まあどっちにしろヤマネコは触らん方がええで」=“Ohhhh, affection, yuck. ...... Well, either way, you shouldn't touch a bobcat.”
「うん……そうだろうね。はぁ、飼いたいなぁ……」=“'Yeah ...... I'm sure you're right. Huh, I wish I could keep her. ......”
「……普通のイエネコで満足した方がええんちゃうかなぁ」=“I guess I should be content with ...... just being a regular weenie.”
「そう簡単に懐かへんやろうし、そもそも飼えへんで」=“I don't think he'll miss you that easily, and you can't keep him in the first place.”
「この前、流れ星を見たんだ。都会の夜空じゃ滅多に見られないから嬉しかったよ」=“I saw a shooting star the other day. It's rare to see them in the night sky in the city, so I was very happy.”
「流れへん星も、見づらいもんなぁ。街の光が明るすぎるのも考えもんやなぁ」=“I can't even see the stars. And the city lights are too bright, too.”
「そうだね。流れ星に願いごとをするなんて、中々できないよね」=“I agree. It's not every day you get to make a wish on a shooting star.”
「この島でやったら、叶うかもしらんで～」=“If you do it on this island, it might come true.”
「うん……流れ星に願い事をする、という願いが叶うかもしれないね」=“Yeah, ...... I might get my wish of making a wish on a shooting star.”
「ややこしい言い回しやで……まあでも、この島におったら、その機会はありそうやね」=“It's a complicated phrase. ...... But I'm sure you'll get the chance when you're on the island.”
「そうだね、いい天気だといいんだけど……」=“Yeah, I hope it's a nice day. ......”
「お天気になりますように……って、まず流れ星に願いをかけんといかんかもしれんね」=“I might have to make a wish on a shooting star first to wish for good weather .......”
「一夜だけ咲く花……サガリバナかぁ。不思議な植物だね」=“A flower that blooms only one night. ...... Sagaribana, huh? It's a mysterious plant.”
「なんや儚くて、可愛らしい花してるのに……一夜だけなんて勿体ないなぁ」=“What a waste of a fragile, pretty flower for just one ...... night.”
「もっと、こう……ガンガンに咲いてくれてもエエと思うねんけど」=“I think it would be good if you bloomed more ......”
「本当にそうだよね。どうやって繁殖してるんだろう？」=“It really is. I wonder how they breed?”
「んー……あんまり繁殖に一生懸命やないんとちゃうかなぁ」=“I guess I'm not trying too hard to breed.”
「……それで絶滅しないってのもすごいよね」=“It's amazing that ...... doesn't make them extinct.”
「ほんまけったいな花やで……でも咲いてるとこ見れたら嬉しいなぁ」=“It's a really pretty flower, and I'd be happy to see it blooming at .......”
「うん、この島にいれば見られるんじゃないかな」=“Yeah, I think you'll see it here on the island.”
「この前、鳥の巣の中に卵を見つけてね……で、無事に孵ったんだ」=“The other day I found an egg in a bird's nest ...... and it hatched safely.”
「へえ～～、それはめでたいこっちゃ。名前はなんて付けたん？」=“I'm so happy for you. What did you name it?”
「い、いや、名前までは……いずれお別れすること確定なんだしさ」=“No, no, I'm sure we'll have to say goodbye to ...... sooner or later, even to our names.”
「あー……たしかに。愛着持ったら、寂しさがエグいことになってまうもんな」=“I'm sure that's true. If you get attached, the loneliness will be too much.”
「でも元気に巣立つまで、見届けたいなぁ……」=“But I want to see it through until it leaves the nest in good health. ......”
「自然のモンやし、触るわけにいかへんし……ほいで、その子、可愛いん？」=“It's a natural thing, and I can't touch it. ...... So, is the girl pretty?”
「……可愛いんだ。名前つけたいなぁ……でもなぁ……」=“I'm ...... pretty. I wish I could name it. ...... but I can't. ......”
「ウチが代わりにつけよか？　『虎の助』はどう？」=“Shall I put it on for you?　How about 'Toranosuke'?”
「……不採用。やっぱ名前は付けないほうがいいよね」=“...... rejected. I knew I shouldn't have named it.”
「見つけたアサガオの芽に水をあげてたんだ。そしたら……花が咲いてくれてさぁ」=“I was watering a morning glory sprout I found. I watered a morning glory sprout I found and it ...... bloomed.”
「へ～、そういうの、エエなぁ～。そういうたら、ウチも子供の頃、育ててたわ」=“I love it when people do that. I used to grow up with one of those when I was a kid.”
「で、夏休みの宿題として、観察日記をつけるんだよね？」=“So, you're going to keep an observation journal for your summer homework, right?”
「うん……けどなぁ、わりと早い段階で枯れてしもたんよなぁ……」=“Yes,...... but it died out rather early on,.......”
「それは寂しいね」=“That's sad.”
「……せやねん。でも宿題が一個減って、ちょっと嬉しいとこもあってんなぁ」=“I've been working on it for a long time. But I'm also a little happy that I have one less homework assignment.”
「……子供は正直だね」=“...... kids are so honest.”
「大人になった今なら、ちゃんと枯らさんと育てられたかもしれへんな～」=“Now that I'm an adult, I could have grown up and not let it die.”
「せやから、自分、よう頑張った思うわ～。一日でも長く咲かせてあげてな」=“I think I did a great job," he said. Let them bloom as long as possible.”
「任せといてよ。しっかり面倒みるよ」=“I'll leave it to you. I'll take good care of you.”
「この近海には、マンタがよく見られるんだって」=“I heard that manta rays are often seen in these waters.”
「なんか、めっちゃデカいやん、あれ……。実際海に潜っとる時に出くわしたら……怖いやろなぁ」=“I don't know, it's really big. ...... It would be ...... scary if we came across it when we were actually diving in the ocean.”
「でも人を襲うような生き物じゃないと思うんだけど……」=“But I don't think they're the kind of creatures that attack people. ......”
「ほいだら安心やな。で、味はどうなん？」=“I'm sure that's a relief. So, how does it taste?”
「あ、味？　どうなんだろ？　エイだから食べられるんだと思うけど……」=“Oh, taste?　What do you think?　I think they're stingrays so they're edible. ......”
「いや、冗談やで。ホンマに食べたいわけちゃうし」=“No, I'm just kidding. I don't really want to eat it.”
「うん……冗談でよかった」=“I'm glad you're joking .......”
「海ほたるって、不思議だよね……」=“Sea fireflies are a mystery. ......”
「めっちゃ綺麗よな～、あれ。でも、『蛍』と関係無いらしいやん」=“It's so beautiful, isn't it? But I heard it has nothing to do with fireflies.”
「うん、ただ光るからってだけで蛍だもんね」=“Yeah, just because they glow, they're fireflies.”
「名付けで損しとるなぁ。『ほな海ほたるで行きましょ』て言うたヤツ誰なん？」=“I guess the name is a bit of a loss. Who said, "Let's go to Umihotaru?”
「そいつ『テキトーな仕事すな！』て、ハリセンでしばかんといかん」=“That guy said, 'Don't do my job! You're going to have to hit me with a sharp stick.”
「じゃあ、『ホタルイカ』『ホタルエビ』の名付けも同罪だねぇ」=“Then naming firefly squid and firefly shrimp is just as bad.”
「野生のウミガメ、見たことある？」=“Have you ever seen a sea turtle in the wild?”
「いやぁ、無いなぁ。野生のおっさんなら見たことあるで。公園とかで」=“No, I don't think so. I've seen old men in the wild. In the park or something.”
「……おっさんで、ウミガメに張り合わないでよ」=“Don't compete with sea turtles at ......, old man.”
「あはは、冗談やーん。ほいで？　どうやった？　防御力高そうやった？」=“Haha, just kidding. And now?　How'd you do?　Did it look defensive?”
「う、うん……まあ、カメだからね。意外と大きくてビックリしたけど」=“Umm, yeah...... well, they're turtles. It's surprisingly big, though.”
「へぇ、なんにせよ、ええもん見れたやん。羨ましいわ～」=“Whatever it was, you got to see some great stuff. I'm jealous!”
「海辺を散歩してたら見つかるかもね」=“Maybe you'll find it when you go for a walk by the sea.”
「せやね、楽しみにしとこーっと」=“Yeah, I'll look forward to it.”
「星の砂って、砂じゃないらしいよ。微生物の殻なんだって」=“I heard that star sand is not sand. It is the shells of microorganisms.”
「そーらしいで。話によると、星でもないっちゅう話や」=“I hear that's true. According to the story, it's not even a star.”
「ウチは火星か冥王星の欠片やと信じとってんけどなぁ」=“I believe it's a piece of Mars or Pluto.”
「……壮大な話だね。でも『星』は形由来だと思うんだけど」=“I'm sure it's all grandiose at ....... But I think 'star' is derived from the form.”
「けど、星型の微生物なんて、不思議だねぇ……」=“But star-shaped microorganisms are a mystery. ......”

「……進化論にあらたな一石を投じる説だね」=“...... is a new twist on the theory of evolution.”
「ウムイの鐘の『ウムイ』って『想い』が訛ったのかな？」=“I wonder if the 'umui' in 'umui bell' is an accent on the word 'thought'?”
「多分そうなんちゃう？　けど、ええ響きやねぇ。なんか可愛らしいわぁ」=“Maybe you're right.　But it sounds great. It's kind of cute.”
「そっちの訛りだと、どんな感じになるの？」=“What would it sound like with your accent?”
「え？　んー……『想い』は『オモイ』やしなぁ……」=“What?　Hmmm... ...... Thoughts are omoi and so on. ......”
「『想いの鐘でんねん。お賽銭頼みまっせ～！』かな？」=“I'm thinking of the bells. I'm asking for money donations! I guess?”
「いや、文章になってるし……」=“No, it's a sentence. ......”
「……今、おっぱいについて考えてるんだけどさぁ」=“I'm thinking about boobs right now at .......”
「お～～……なんでそんなこと考えてんのか、教えてもらえる？」=“Can you tell me why you're thinking of ...... that?”

「うんうん、好きなことについて考えるんは大事やね～」=“Yeah, it's important to think about what you like.”
「けど……わざわざ口に出さんでもエエんと違う？　ウチ、ちょっと恥ずかしい……」=“But ...... you don't have to say it out loud, do you?　I'm a little embarrassed. ......”
「そ、そう？　それは残念だ……」=“Oh, yeah?　Sorry to hear that. ......”
「フェティシズム……ああ、フェティシズム、フェティシズム……」=“Fetishism......oh, fetishism, fetishism......”
「……急に一句読むやん。一体どないしたん？」=“I'm reading a passage from ...... all of a sudden. What the hell is wrong with you?”
「フェチについて考えてたんだ。[H名]は何フェチ？」=“I was thinking about fetishes. What fetishes does [H名] have?”
「ド直球な質問やなぁ……んー……んんん～～……ちょっと考えさせて？」=“I'm sure you've got a lot of questions for me, but let me think for a minute.”
「わかった。待つよ、いつまでも待つからね」=“I'll be there. I'll wait. I'll wait forever.”
「……時間おいて、返答を有耶無耶にしようとするウチの意図、あっさり挫いてくるやん……」=“...... you easily frustrate our intention to delay and delay our response. ......”
「ちょっと欲求不満気味なんだけど、[H名]はどう？」=“I'm feeling a little frustrated, [H名]?”
「うわぁ、なんかめっちゃグイグイ来る～～……」=“Wow, it's kinda gnarly~~~......”
「なにせ、欲求不満だからね。グイグイ行くよ」=“I'm not very happy about it. I'll go for it.”
「はぁ……もっと、こう……デリカシー的な何かが欲しいなぁ……」=“I'd like to see something more ...... delicately ...... like this.”
「で？　どうなの？　そっちは欲求不満だったりしないの？　ねえ、ねえ……」=“And?　What do you think?　Aren't you frustrated over there?　Hey, hey ......”
「ひえぇぇ……ホンマ、堪忍してぇ～～……」=“Heeeee ...... Honma, bear with me~~......”
「初体験って、どうだった？」=“How was your first time?”
「えらいざっくりと聞いてくるやん……ま、まあ……痛かった……かな？」=“You're asking me a lot of broad ...... questions, well, ...... that was painful, wasn't it?”
「あー……痛かったかぁ。申し訳ない」=“I said, Oh, ...... that hurt. My apologies.”
「い、いや……多分どないやっても痛かった思うで？」=“No, no, ...... probably would have hurt no matter how you did it, right?”
「そういうもんや思て、割り切ってたからそないツラいことなかったけど」=“I thought that's the way it was, and it wasn't that hard for me.”
「俺は最高だったよ！！」=“I was great!”
「うん、その顔とテンションだけで、もうお腹いっぱいやわ……」=“Yeah, I'm so sick and tired of that face and tension alone. ......”
