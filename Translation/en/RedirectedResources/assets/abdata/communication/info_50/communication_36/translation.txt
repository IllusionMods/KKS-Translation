「あら、躾がなっていない豚を見つけたわ。そこに正座なさい」=“Oh my, looks like I've found an untrained pig. Kneel right there.”
「へぇ、その勇気は買ってあげる。でも、それは命知らずと言うのよ」=“Hoh, you have guts, I'll give you that. However, that's just a deathwish.”
「貴方と違って、私は忙しいの。いいわねぇ、家畜は年中暇で、フフッ」=“Unlike you, I'm busy. Isn't it great, livestock have free time all year round, Fufu--”
「……んっ、フフッ……そうよ……下僕にしてあげる……」=“...Nn--, Fufu--... That's right... I'll make you my manservant...”
「はぁ……３秒あげる。いますぐ目を閉じるか、私に潰されるか、選びなさい」=“Haa... I'll give you 3 seconds. Would you prefer to shut your eyes right now, or would you prefer being crushed by me, take your pick.”
「ほら、おすわり。私が肌を晒してあげてるのよ？　礼儀をわきまえなさい」=“Here, Sit. I'm exposing my skin, you know? Have some manners.”
「私を連れ回したのだから、相応の話があるのでしょうね？　ん？」=“Since you dragged me here, you must have something worthy to say, right? Hmm?”
「ふーん、私も舐められたものね。その頭、文字通り叩き直してあげるわ」=“Hmm, I was underestimated as well, huh? That head of yours, I'll quite literally beat it back into shape for you.”
「良い所に来たわね。丁度暇だったから、貴方の無駄話に付き合ってあげる」=“You came at the right time. I've just got some free time, so I'll go along with your banal chitchat.”
「溜まってるなら素直に言いなさい？　無様に晒してあげるわ」=“If you're bottled up, just tell me honestly, okay? I'll make an unsightly show out of you.”
「あぁ、いたの。よかったわね、私に認識してもらえて」=“Aah, so you're here. Feels good, doesn't it, to be noticed by me?”
「何か用？　間抜け面を晒しに来て、私に嫌がらせをしたいのかしら？」=“You need something? Do you just want to harass me with that stupid face of yours?”
「なに？　家畜の癖に用事でもあるの？」=“What? Does livestock like you need something from me?”
「用件があるならさっさとすませなさい」=“If you've got something to ask then get it over with already.”
「もしかして、女王様って呼ばれてたりしない？」=“Perhaps, will you not call me Queen?”
「そう呼びたいなら、好きになさい。フフ、またペットが増えてしまったわ」=“If you want to call me that, go for it. Fufu, I've got one more pet now.”
「偉そうと言いたいの？　家畜の分際で、随分生意気な口を利くのね」=“You want to talk big? For livestock, you sure run your mouth a lot.”
「この旅行でやりたいことってある？」=“Is there anything you wanna do on this trip?”
「一通り名所を回るつもりよ。残念だけど、貴方を苛める予定はないわ」=“I'm planning on making a round of all the famous places. Sorry but, there's no time in my schedule to play with you.”
「優雅にバカンスを楽しむつもりよ。……私の邪魔をしたらどうなるか、分かっているわね？」=“I'm just going to enjoy this vacation elegantly. ...You know what'll happen to you, if you get in the way of that, right?”
「貴方、退屈ね。もう少し楽しませてくれると思ったのだけれど」=“You're such a drag. I thought you'd be a bit more entertaining.”
（[H名]さんを楽しませる様な話題を振らないと……）=(I gotta think of something that she'll enjoy talking about...)
「……何を考えているのか知らないけど、黙りこくるより喋りなさい。どんなにつまらない話でも、沈黙よりはマシよ」=“...I don't know what you're thinking over there but, actually say something. No matter how boring it is, it'll be better than this silence.”
「[H名]さんって、誰にでもそんな感じなの？」=“[H名]-san, are you like this with everyone?”
「当たり前でしょ。……何？　もっと雑に扱って欲しいの？」=“That's obvious, no?... What? You want me to treat you even more roughly?”
「この間見かけたんだけど……」=“The other day, I came across...”
「そう……欠片ほども興味が湧かないわね」=“I see. ...Can't say I feel even the slightest shred of interest.”
「その……[H名]さんって人を好きになることってあるの？」=“Uhm... Have you ever liked anyone at all, [H名]-san?”
「私をなんだと思っているの？　……まぁ、今のところないけれど、いつかはそういう日がくるんじゃない？」=“Just what do you take me for? ...Well, I haven't yet but, someday it'll happen, no?”
「好きになることがあったとしても、貴方には関係のないことよ。だって貴方は人じゃなくて家畜だもの。初めから対象外だわ」=“Even if I did, what does that matter to you? You're not a person but rather livestock. It's outside your realm.”
「[H名]さんって、恋愛漫画とか読んだりするの？」=“Do you ever read romance manga and whatnot, [H名]-san?”
「試しに読んだことはあるけど……私には合わなかったわ」=“I did read one once, just to see... can't say I liked it.”
「漫画に限らず、恋愛要素を一番に押し出している作品に興味はないわ。登場人物に共感できないもの」=“I have no interest in romance anything, not just manga. I can't relate at all to the characters.”
「好きな男性のタイプを教えてくれる？」=“Can you tell me the type of boys you like?”
「そうね、何事も学ぶ意欲の高い人かしら。先の見えていない奴は嫌いよ」=“Let's see, I suppose those that have a big drive to learn just about anything. I hate guys who can't plan for the future.”
「まさか、自分がタイプだと言われるとか期待してる？　貴方は男性ではなくオスでしょ？」=“By any chance, are you hoping that I'll say "You're just my type" or something? You're not a man, you're an animal, no?”
「貴方、露骨過ぎるのよ。何もわかっていないのね」=“You're way too crude. You don't understand anything, do you?”
「友達が言ってたんだけど……」=“A friend of mine was...”
「家畜の友達だけあって、女心というものがまるで分ってなさそうね」=“You lot really don't understand what goes on in a girl's heart, huh? I suppose that's livestock for you.”
「ファーストキスって……」=“Your first kiss...”
「……初めてを大事にする気持ちを否定するつもりはないわ」=“...I'm not going to deny that I do value my first time with things.”
「ズバリ聞くけど、[H名]さんって俺の事どう思ってるの？」=“I'll be frank, what do you think of me, [H名]-san?”
「ただの家畜よ。最初に言ったでしょう？　物覚えが悪いわね」=“I think of you as just livestock. I said so at the start, no? You sure have a bad memory.”
「積極的な男ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of assertive boys?”
「何もできないノロマよりは、失敗してでも前に進む方が見所はあるわね」=“Rather than dimwits who can't bring themselves to make a move, the fact that they move forward regardless of failure is praiseworthy.”
「愚図は嫌いよ。でも、間違った方向に突き進む奴はもっと嫌いね」=“I hate dullards. But, I hate guys who keep pushing on in the wrong direction even more.”
「慎重な男性って好き？」=“Do you like cautious boys?”
「悪くはないわね。足りない脳でも、回さないよりは幾らかマシでしょ」=“They're not bad. Even if they're slow in the head, that's still somewhat better than those who don't use their heads at all.”
「面倒でしかないわ。足枷にしかならないような男は願い下げね」=“They're nothing but a pain. Spare me from having to deal with guys who can't be anything but a burden.”
「勤勉な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of hard-working guys?”
「好ましいわね。学ぶ姿勢は伸びしろに繋がるわ。成長のない男は嫌いなの」=“They're pretty likeable. A hard-working disposition means room for growth. I hate guys who can't mature.”
「厄介ね、そういう男は自分のルールを押し付けたがるわ。滅ぼすべきよ」=“They're a nuisance, those kinds of guys force their own rules upon others. They should be destroyed.”
「マイペースな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of guys who move at their own pace?”
「いいんじゃない。自由を奪って、泣かせてやりたくなるわ」=“They're fine, no? They make me want to snatch away their freedom, and make them break down in tears.”
「いらない存在ね。私に合わせられない男になんて興味はないわ」=“I don't think they need to exist. I have no interest in boys who won't match their pace with mine.”
「優しい男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of kind and gentle guys?”
「いいわね。どこまで良い人でいられるのか、試したくなる」=“They're pretty good. Makes me wanna test them, check just how far their kindness can stretch before it breaks.”
「退屈ね。そういう男って、大抵つまらないのよ」=“They're a drag. Those kinds of guys are generally very boring.”
「クールな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of cool guys?”
「自信があるのは良い事よ。それをポッキリ折ってあげた時の顔が楽しみ」=“It's a good thing to have self-confidence. It's really fun to watch their expressions as I snap it off.”
「ナルシストはお呼びじゃないわ。気持ち悪くて吐き気がする」=“Narcissists are unasked for. They're so disgusting it actually makes me nauseated.”
「オナニーを始めたのって、どれくらいから？」=“Just when did you start masturbating?”
「は？　貴方、少し息を止めてなさい。深刻な空気汚染よそれ……」=“Hah? You should stop breathing for a while. That's some serious air pollution...”
「逆に貴方はいつなの？　教えなさい」=“When was yours? Tell me.”
「[H名]さんって鞭とか似合いそうだよね……ほら、エッチの時とかさ」=“Feels like a whip would suit you, [H名]-san... Like when doing lewd stuff and whatnot.”
「ふぅん、そういう趣味があるのね？　いいわよ、泣く程痛めつけてあげる」=“Hmm, so you like that sort of stuff, huh? Alright then, I'll torment you with one till you cry.”
「ならすぐに用意しなさい。くだらない発言を後悔させてあげるわ」=“If so, then prepare one at once. I'll make you regret those stupid remarks of yours.”
「エッチの時は、優しくなったりする？」=“Are you gentle in bed?”
「しないわ。そういう時こそ、相手の泣き顔を見て楽しむものでしょう？」=“Nope. Afterall, Isn't that the best time to enjoy your partner's tear stained face?”
「普段は優しくないと言いたいの？　ふぅん、貴方何様？」=“Are you trying to imply that I'm not usually gentle? Hmm, who do you think you are?”
「下半身でしかモノを考えられないの？　救いようのない下等生物ね」=“Can you not think about literally anything other than sex? Truly an irredeemable lifeform, you are.”
（よし、エッチなことを聞いてみるぞっ！）=(Alright, I'll ask something lewd!)
「待ちなさい、口を開かないで。まずはその、いやらしい顔を何とかして」=“Stop, don't open your mouth. First, do something about that obscene expression on your face.”
「女の子にも性欲はあるよね？」=“Girls have sexual drives too, don't they?”
「あるわよ。男の泣き顔って、すっごくゾクゾクするもの」=“We do. Looking at a boy's crying face makes me so incredibly horny.”
「はぁ～、エッチしたいなぁ～……なんちゃって！」=“Haa~, I wanna have sex~... Kidding!”
「豚がヒトと交尾したいの？　貴方危険ね、即刻処分した方がいいかしら？」=“A pig wants to mate with humans? You're dangerous, wonder if I should deal with you, nip the problem in the bud?”
「ん？　何かあるならはっきり言いなさい、その口は飾り？」=“Nn? If you have something to say, then speak up. Is that mouth just a decoration?”
「目を合わせてこないで、気持ち悪いわ」=“Don't look at me in the eyes, it's really disgusting.”
「貴方の顔、悪夢に出てきそう。気つけにはいいかもね」=“I feel like your face is going to show up in my nightmares. Would work pretty well as an alarm clock.”
「結局そこを見るのね、単純過ぎて呆れるわ」=“In the end, your eyes end up there. You're such a simpleton, it's almost disgusting.”
「バレてないと思ってる？　次は目を抉るわ、一切容赦はしない」=“You think I can't tell where you're looking? Next time, I won't go easy on you, I'll straight up gouge out your eyes.”
「はい、残念。面倒だから自分で目を潰しなさい、ほら早くしなさい愚図」=“Welp, unfortunately, it has come to this. It's a pain, so just crush your own eyes, please. Come on, get to it quickly, you slowpoke.”
「見ているのに何もわからない。低能過ぎて溜息が出るわ……はぁっ」=“Even looking at you, I still don't understand a thing. You're such an imbecile, its making me sigh involuntarily... Haa--”
「ふぅん、そんなに手がいらないの？　無いと色々不便よ？」=“Hmmm, you really want to part with your hands that much? You know that many things become inconvenient without them, right?”
「言葉が通じないのなら、体に覚えさせるしかないわね」=“If words won't get through to you, I have no choice but to make your body remember, do I?”
「わかった、痛くしてあげる。まさか、犬以下の変態だったなんてね」=“Okay then, I'll make you feel pain. To think you were a perverted mutt, worse than an actual dog.”
「で？　この後はどうするつもり？　考え無しなら酷い事になるけど？」=“So? What do you plan to do after this? If you say you didn't think it through, it'll turn out really badly for you.”
「気の迷い、ではすまないわよ？　それとも、豚は豚箱にという事かしら？」=“You can't pass this off as you losing your head in the moment, you know? Or is it that you want to be a dog in the pound?”
「短い付き合いだったわね。次に会えるのは何年後かしら……フフッ」=“That sure was a short friendship. Wonder how many years it'll be till we meet again... Fufu--”
「へぇ、何のつもりかしら？　私の頭を汚して、タダで済むと思っているの？」=“Heh, what were you thinking? Defiling my head like this, did you think you'd get away scott-free?”
「やめなさい。汚い手で触らないで、雑菌が移るわ」=“Stop that. Don't touch me with your filthy hands, you'll make me catch your germs.”
「はぁっ、言葉が通じる相手だと思った私が馬鹿だった、それだけの事ね」=“Haa--, I was an idiot to think that I could get through to you with words, wasn't I?”
「ねぇ、私も頬を触らせて？　貴方だって、誰もわからなくしてあげるわ」=“Hey, let me touch your cheeks too? I'll make it so that no one can ever recognize you again.”
「軽薄ね。考えも行動も、何もかも軽くて薄くて、嫌になるわ」=“So superficial. Both your thinking and your conduct, just about everything is trivial and shallow, it makes me disgusted.”
「少しは怖さを教えてあげた方がいいみたいね。はぁ、私って優しいわ」=“Looks like it'll be good for me to teach you some fear. Haa, I'm such a kind person.”
「安心なさい、手が使えなくなっても飼ってあげるわ。私のペットとしてね」=“Be at peace, for I will raise you even if you are unable to use your hands anymore. As my pet, that is.”
「フフッ、貴方、案外見所があるかもしれないわね」=“Fufu--, Unexpectedly, you may actually have some good points.”
「ほら、私は何を望んでる？　無い頭を使って考えなさい。長くは待たないわよ」=“Here, what am I wishing for? Use your non-existent brain and think about it. I won't wait for too long.”
「私が一番嫌いなものを教えてあげましょうか？　退屈よ」=“Shall I tell you the thing I hate the most? It is boredom.”
「無駄な時間ね……不愉快だわ」=“Such a waste of time... It's really unpleasant.”
「さようなら。もう二度と、私の視界に入らない事、わかったわね？」=“Goodbye. Never appear in my field of view, ever again, got it?”
「顔も見たくないって、こういう事を言うのね。一つ勉強になったわ」=“When people say "I don't even wanna see your face ever again", this is the kind of thing they're talking about, huh. I learned something today.”
「喜びなさい、また私と話す事を許可してあげる」=“Rejoice, I'll allow you to talk to me again.”
「さて、話は終わり。次は期待してるわ。何をかは自分で考えなさい」=“Now then, our chat ends here. I'm looking forward to the next time. Think over just what exactly I'm looking forward to.”
「んっ、ここまでにしましょうか。ほら、話に付き合ってあげたお礼は？」=“Nn--, let's leave it at that. Come now, where's my "thanks" for keeping you company?”
「暇潰しにはなったわ。それじゃ」=“It was a good waste of time, I suppose.”
「ふぅん、私ともう話す事はないと？　貴方、何様？」=“Hmmm, you have nothing more to talk to me about? Who do you think you are?”
「は？　何がしたかったの？　馬鹿にしないで」=“Hah? Just what did you say you wanted to do? Don't be ridiculous.”
「一緒に島を観光しない？」=“Wanna go sightseeing together?”
「私の邪魔をしないなら、別にいいわ」=“If you won't get in my way then I suppose we can.”
「どうして私が貴方と観光しないといけないのかしら？」=“And just why do I have to do that?”
「よかったら、これから二人で遊ばない？」=“Hey, wanna go have some fun together?”
「遊ぶ相手がいないの？　惨めね……可哀想だから付き合ってあげるわ」=“You don't have anyone to walk around with? How miserable... you're really pitiful so I'll come along with you.”
「いやよ。ひとりで虚しく遊んでなさい」=“No way. Run around by your own pathetic self.”
「えっと……一緒に体験コーナーに行かない？」=“Erhm... wanna go hit up the experience corner together?”
「そうね……研修の為の旅行だし、付き合ってあげるわ」=“I suppose... we're on a study trip anyway, so I don't mind.”
「貴方と一緒に行く必要性が皆無ね」=“There is no reason for me to do it with you.”
「お腹が空いてたら、これからご飯にしない？」=“If you're feeling hungry, wanna go have a meal?”
「運がよかったわね。たまたま小腹が空いてたから、一緒に食べてあげるわ」=“It's your lucky day. I was just feeling hungry, so I'll let you have this chance.”
「私が家畜と一緒に食事をする……？　冗談でしょ？」=“Me, dining with livestock like you...? You're joking, right?”
「ちょっと付いてきてもらっていい？」=“Could you come with me for a moment?”
「いいわ、丁度暇を持て余していたし。貴方でも暇潰しくらいにはなるでしょう」=“Alright, I have too much free time anyway. Even someone like you can help me with atleast killing some time.”
「はぁ？　貴方の思い通りに私を動かそうなんて、思い上がりも甚だしいわ」=“Haa? Trying to make me move according to your will, there should be a limit to your conceit.”
「馬鹿につける薬は無いと言うけれど、変態にも無さそうね」=“They say there's no cure for stupidity, but I suppose that applies to perversion as well, huh.”
「誰？　私に豚や変態の知り合いはいないけれど？」=“Who is it? I don't think I know any pigs or perverts?”
「へぇ、もうこの時点で、何を言っても言い訳よ？　覚悟しなさい」=“Heh, at this point, no matter what you say, it is just an excuse, you know? Prepare yourself.”
「さて、通報っと。さようなら、短い付き合いだったわね」=“Now then, there, reported. Goodbye, it sure was a short relationship.”
「話は後にして。後で聞いてあげると言っているのよ、感謝してどきなさい」=“Leave the chitchat for later. I'm saying that Ill listen to what you have to say later, so be grateful and move aside for now.”
「はぁ、本当に低俗ね。そのみっともなく膨らんだもの、潰してあげましょうか？」=“Haa, truly vulgar. That disgraceful inflated thing, shall I crush it?”
「良かったわね。これで貴方は一生私に逆らえないわ。フフッ」=“Great. With this, you can never disobey me again, for your whole life. Fufu--”
「ほら、感想は？　男の目線というのも興味あるわ。正直に言ってみなさい」=“Hey, Thoughts? I am rather interested in a man's point of view. Tell me frankly.”
「よーく見ておきなさい。貴方が水着を見れる機会なんて、この先ないでしょうから」=“Take a gooood look. Afterall, you likely won't get another chance to look at a girl's swimsuit after this.”
「落ち着きがないわね。一体何がしたいの？」=“You're not very calm, are you. Just what do you want to do?”
「さようなら、変態マゾ豚さん。二度と誘わないでね？」=“Goodbye, Mr. Perverted Masochistic Pig. Never invite me again, okay?”
「少し貴方の話を聞かせなさい。これは命令よ、拒否権はないわ」=“Chat with me for a bit. This is an order, you don't have the right to refuse.”
「欲求不満で暴走されても困るから、溜まっているなら先に言いなさい」=“It'll be bothersome if you behave recklessly out of frustration, so let me know when it piles up.”
「あら、いつからいたの？　貴方って影が薄いのね」=“Oh my, since when have you been there? You don't particularly stand out, do you?”
「私が相手をしてあげるのよ？　感謝の言葉は？」=“I'll keep you company. Where's my "thanks"?”
「分かってると思うけど、くだらない話はしないでちょうだい」=“I'm sure you get it but, don't waste my time with pointless yapping.”
「わざわざ声をかけたのだから、私を楽しませてくれるのでしょう？」=“You went out of your way to stop me like this, so you'll show me a good time, right?”
「[H名]さんってカリスマがあるよね」=“[H名]-san, you have a lot of charisma, don't you?”
「また短絡的な誉め言葉ね。貴方がどれくらい薄っぺらい人間かわかるわ」=“Again with the simplistic compliments. I already know just how much of a flimsy and shallow human being you are.”
「私はそんなつもりはないけれどね。豚共が勝手についてくるだけよ」=“I don't particularly aim for that. It's just that pigs tend to crowd around me by themselves.”
「[H名]さんって、ゲームとかやったりするの？」=“Do you ever play any games, [H名]-san?”
「たまにボードゲームで遊んだりするわ。勧めてあげたいところだけど、家畜はルールを覚えることすら出来ないでしょうね」=“I play some boardgames sometimes. I'd tell you, but livestock like you probably won't even be able to remember the rules.”
「逆に聞くけど、私がゲームで遊んでる姿が想像つく？　……そういうことよ」=“I'll ask you instead, can you imagine me playing games? ...Exactly.”
「服の流行とか気にする？」=“Do you pay attention to fashion and things?”
「流行っているからという理由で買うことはないわ。私が気に入るかどうかが全てよ」=“I never buy things based on what's popular. What's important is whether I like it.”
「特に気にならないわね。その時に着たい服を私は着るだけよ」=“Not really. I just wear whatever I want to wear.”
「歌の歌詞とか気にするタイプ？」=“Do you care about the singers in the music you listen to?”
「曲とボーカルの相性が全てよ。耳心地が良ければ、内容なんてどうでもいいわ」=“What's important is whether the vocals fit well with the song. As long as it's good to listen to, I couldn't care less about it.”
「そもそも歌がある曲を聴くことの方が稀ね」=“To begin with, I don't listen to much music with vocals.”
「つまらない事ばかり聞かないで。本物のブタと話してた方がまだマシよ」=“Don't harp on about boring things. Talking with an actual pig would be more interesting than this.”
「この前の話なんだけどね……」=“Just the other day...”
「豚の日常に興味はないわ。どうせくだらない話でしょう？」=“I have no interest in hearing about a pig's everyday struggles. It's going to be pointless anyway.”
「恋人には実は尽くすタイプだったりする？」=“Are you the type to devote yourself to your boyfriend?”
「えぇ、それはもう厳しくね。優しくするだけが愛じゃないのよ？」=“Yes, with tough love. Just being kind and gentle isn't love, you know?”
「は？　尽くす？　私が？　月並みだけど、寝言は寝て言えというやつね」=“Hah? Devote? Me? I know this is a cliché phrase but, leave the sleep-talking for when you're actually sleeping.”
「亭主関白な人ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of people who prefer the domineering husband sort of relationships?”
「価値観の更新ができない、古い時代に取り残された無能ね」=“Incompetents who can't keep up with the times, the lot of them.”
「関白に見合うだけの対価を提供出来ているなら、別にいいんじゃない？　まぁ、私はそれでも許しはしないけれど」=“As long as the husband's actually bringing something to the table, isn't it fine? Well, not that I'd ever accept that in any circumstance.”
「もし恋人と喧嘩したらどうする？」=“If you had a fight with your boyfriend, what would you do?”
「ありえない仮定の話だけど、もし私に非があるのなら謝罪はするわ。相手に非があるのなら……フフッ、大変なことになると思うわ」=“It's never going to happen but, if I'm the one at fault then I'd apologize. However, if it's them... fufuh--, it's going to be real something, I'll tell you that.”
「ただの喧嘩でしょ？　別にどうもしないわ。もしそれで縁が切れてしまう様なら、それまでの関係だったのよ」=“It'd just be a fight, no? I wouldn't do anything. If that leads to the relationship falling apart, then that's all it was worth anyway.”
「恋愛は惚れた方の負けだって考え方があるけど、どう思う？」=“They say that the first to fall in love loses but, what do you think?”
「さぁ？　どっちが先に好きになったかなんて、どうでもいいでしょ。結局、その二人に合った関係に落ち着くものよ」=“Who knows? What does that matter anyway? In the end, it's about settling into the sort of relationship that fits you.”
「当てはまる人たちもいるんじゃない？　でも私には関係のないことよ」=“There's probably lots of people that fit the bill, no? Nothing to do with me though.”
「くだらない話ね。脳を取り出して、桃色に塗ってあげましょうか？」=“What an absurd topic. Shall I extract your brain and paint it pink?”
「は～、恋人が欲しいなぁ～」=“Haa~, I want a girlfriend~”
「なら早く家畜小屋に帰りなさい。ここにメスブタはいないわよ？」=“Then go back to your pen post-haste. There are no sows here, you know?”
「女の子の絶頂って長いって聞くけど、本当？」=“I've heard that a girl's climax lasts pretty long, is it really true?”
「本当よ。出して終わりの男とは違うの、余韻を楽しむ余裕があるのよ」=“It is. Unlike boys, who're done after they shoot it out, girls get to enjoy the lingering sensation.”
「男だって、開発すれば女のようにイケるわ。女々しい貴方には似合いそうね」=“Even boys, if they're trained properly, can learn to cum like women. I think it'd suit you, with how effeminate and unmanly you are.”
「女の子同士で、エッチな事ってしたことある？」=“Have you ever done anything lewd with another girl?”
「あるわよ。躾けて欲しいとお願いされたら、断るのも可哀相でしょ？」=“I have. If they beg me to train and discipline them, wouldn't it be sad if I just refused them?”
「それは女の秘密というものよ、軽々しく男が知っていい話ではないわ」=“That's a secret between girls, not something fun to be thoughtlessly told to a boy.”
「女の子の匂いってエッチだよね？」=“Girls have an erotic scent to them, don't they?”
「そうね、貴方のドブのような匂いとは大違い。芳香剤でも飲んだら？」=“Indeed, there's a big difference compared to your sewer-like smell. Why not try gulping down some air freshner?”
「それは貴方が男だからよ。浅はかで、肉欲丸出しな発言ね」=“That's because you're a guy. That's a really undisguised shallow and horny remark, you know?”
「エッチしたいって思った事ある？」=“Have you ever wanted to do lewd stuff?”
「あるわ。気に入った相手の、全てを支配したいと思うのは当然でしょ？」=“I have. It's a matter of course for one to want to dominate every bit of someone they're interested in, no?”
「貴方はどうなの？　いえ、やっぱりいいわ。聞くまでもないもの」=“What about you? No, don't tell me, I don't need to hear it to know the answer.”
「まるでサカリのついたサルね。動物園に帰りなさい」=“You're like a monkey in heat. Go back to the zoo.”
「周りが女の子だらけだと、ムラムラしちゃうね……」=“Having all these girls and only girls around me, it makes me horny...”
「なら無様に一人で慰めたら？　得意でしょ？」=“Then why don't you go and play with yourself in that unsightly manner? It's your speciality, no?”
「私と目を合わせる時は、跪いて見上げなさい。それが作法よ」=“When making eye contact with me, you must kneel and look up at me while doing so. That is the proper etiquette.”
「目で何か訴えているつもり？　理解する気もないから、口を使いなさい」=“Are you trying to communicate something with those eyes? I don't even feel like bothering to make sense of it, so use your mouth.”
「右目と左目、どっちがいいかしら？　片方は残してあげる、優しいでしょ？」=“Your left eye or your right eye, which would you prefer? I'll leave you one, aren't I kind?”
「そんなに胸が好き？　フッ、甘えん坊な証拠ね」=“You like breasts that much? Pfft, proof that you're a pampered child.”
「貴方、胸を見ながら私と話す気？　随分偉くなったのね」=“You plan on talking with me while staring at my breasts like that? Gotten pretty cocky, haven't we?”
「胸を見に来ただけなら、一生写真集でも見ていなさい」=“If you've come just to stare at breasts, then just look at a porn magazine for your whole life instead.”
「重大な事を見落として、何処を見ているの？　その目は飾り？」=“Just where are you looking, overlooking the actual important thing? Are those eyes just for decoration?”
「この手は何？　私に差し出すという事でいいのかしら？」=“What's with this hand? Can I safely assume you're sacrificing it to me?”
「何の意図かは知らないけれど、私の手に触れた。それだけで罪よ？」=“I don't know what your intentions were, but you did touch my hand. That by itself is a sin, you know?”
「そう、そんなに罰が欲しいのね。この変態マゾ豚は」=“I see, you want to be punished that much, huh. This perverted masochistic pig.”
「ふぅん、貴方は最後の晩餐に、胸を選んだのね」=“Hmmm, so you picked breasts for your last meal, huh?”
「きついお仕置きが必要なようね。はぁ、家畜の相手って面倒だわ」=“Looks like a severe punishment is required. Haa, It's hard to keep livestock company.”
「しばらく手を使えなくしてあげる。家畜らしく、餌は口で食べなさい」=“For the time being, I'll make it so you can't use your hands. Like the livestock you are, eat your fodder directly with your mouth.”
「私を虚仮にしているの？　今すぐやめた方が身のためよ？」=“Are you trying to make a fool out of me? You'd better stop if you want to live to see another day.”
「はぁ、私の優しい忠告を無視するなんて、貴方どうかしてるわ」=“Haa, ignoring my kind warnings, something's definitely wrong with your head.”
「ハンマーを持ってきなさい。その手の骨、粉々にしてあげる」=“Bring a hammer. I'll smash the bones in that hand to bits for you.”
「綺麗なものに触れたくなる気持ちはわかるわ。でも、私のトゲは痛いわよ？」=“I understand the feeling of wanting to touch pretty things, I do. But, my thorns hurt a lot, you know?”
「貴方の頬も出しなさい、擦り切れるまで撫で回してあげる」=“Show me your cheek as well, I'll rub it for you, until there's nothing left.”
「やたらと頬を触ってくる豚を駆除するには、何が一番効果的かしら」=“I wonder what's the most effective way, to exterminate a pig who thoughtlessly touches others' cheeks.”
「誰が私に近付いていいと言ったの？　下がりなさい」=“Who told you that you could get close to me? Step back.”
「貴方、苛めて楽しむ分には、なかなか面白い豚になってきたわね」=“For the amount of enjoyment I get from teasing you, you've sure become quite the amusing pig.”
「豚の繁殖方法にも興味が出てきたわ、少し話してみなさい」=“I suddenly have some interest in the way pigs reproduce, tell me about it.”
「で、他にもまだ何かあるの？　無いなら私は行くわよ？」=“So, do you have anything else to say? If not, I'm going to go.”
「悩むだけ無駄よ。どうせつまらない話しかできないのだから」=“It's pointless to agonize over it. You can't think of anything interesting to talk about anyway.”
「退屈は嫌いと言った筈よ。貴方、どこまで私を怒らせるつもり？」=“I could've sworn I told you that I hate tedium. Just how much are you trying to provoke me?”
「貴方、不愉快ね。あまりにも愚か過ぎて、言葉を失うわ」=“You're unpleasant. You're so excessively stupid, I'm at a loss for words.”
「今すぐ私の前から消えなさい、愚図」=“Get out of my sight at once, blockhead.”
「少しは楽しめたわ。次も期待してあげるから、応えてみせなさい」=“I was able to enjoy it a bit. I look forward to enjoying it next time as well, so try hard to meet my expectations.”
「次は思っている事を包み隠さず話しなさい。どんな事でもね。フフッ」=“Next time, tell me directly what you're thinking about, without hiding it. No matter what it is. Fufu--”
「さて、暇潰しは終わりよ。じゃあね」=“Now then, no more time to kill. See ya.”
「それじゃ、私はもう行くわ」=“Well then, I'm gonna go.”
「まぁ、家畜にしては話題選びを頑張ったわね」=“Well, I saw that you tried your best, in your own livestock way.”
「私が相手をしてあげる価値をわかっていないようね。はぁ、これだから家畜は……」=“You don't understand the value of me keeping you company, do you? Haa, this is why livestock are...”
「貴方、ふざけてるの？　だとしたら随分命知らずね」=“Are you screwing around? If so, you're quite the daredevil.”
「俺……[H名]さんのことが好きだ！」=“I... love you, [H名]!”
「家畜に好意を持たれても、鬱陶しいだけね」=“Being loved by livestock, my life truly is complete.”
「私が今から言うことを一言一句聞き逃さないようにしなさい。……貴方の事、私の下僕にしてあげてもいいわよ」=“Do not miss a single word of what I am about to say. ...I wouldn't mind making you my manservant.”
「こんなチャンスを逃すなんて……だからいつまでも豚なのよ」=“Letting a chance like this go... that's why you'll always be a pig.”
「あー、えーっと……[H名]さんと、Ｈしてみたいなー。なんて……」=“Aah, Errhm... I wanna try having sex with you, [H名]-san. Kidding...”
「はぁ？　豚と交尾なんて、考えただけでもおぞましい事を言わないで」=“Haa? Mating with a pig, don't ask me stuff that makes me repulsed just by thinking about it.”
「[H名]さん、また性欲処理をお願いしたいんだけど？」=“[H名]-san, I'd like to ask you to manage my sexual desires again, if possible.”
「まったく、本当にケモノのような性欲ね。まぁいいわ、手早く済ませてあげる」=“Good Grief, you truly have a beastly sexual drive. Well, it's fine, I'll take care of it quickly.”
「調子に乗らないで。そんなに溜まっているなら、一人で惨めに処理しなさい」=“Don't get carried away. If you're that bottled up, then deal with it by your own pathetic lonesome.”
「ここで、[H名]さんとＨしたい！　お願いします！」=“I want to have sex with you here, [H名]-san! Please!”
「こら、吠えない。でもそうね、駄犬の醜態を晒すのも、少し面白そうかしら」=“Hey, don't howl. But, yes, putting a mutt's pathetic behaviour on display for everyone, that sounds kinda interesting.”
「今すぐ黙りなさい。呼吸も禁止よ。そのまま窒息するといいわ」=“Be quiet this instant. Breathing is also forbidden. Would be nice if you could just choke to death like that.”
「ここで[H名]さんとＨがしたいです。お願いします」=“I would like to have sex with you here, [H名]-san. Please.”
「ふぅん、露出癖があるのね。いいわ、人としてのプライドを、ズタズタにしてあげる」=“Hmm, so you're into exhibitionism, huh. Alright then, your pride as a human being, I'll tear it to shreds for you.”
「吠えるな駄犬。祖チンを自分で擦って、勝手に処理してなさい」=“Don't howl, you damned mutt. Rub your own dick and deal with it yourself.”
「ンフッ、貴方の粗末なモノを苛めたくなってきたわ。ほら、早く出しなさい」=“nfuu--, I feel like teasing your dick. Come on, take it out quickly.”
「いい子ね。たくさん泣かせて、私無しではいられなくしてあげるわ」=“What a nice child. I'll make it cry lots, and make it so it's unable to live without me.”
「ん？　恥ずかしがっているの？　家畜の分際で、生意気ね」=“Hm? Are you shy? For livestock, you sure are cheeky.”
「あのさ、一緒に買い物でもしない？」=“Listen, wanna go shopping together?”
「あら、私の荷物持ちがしたいの？　殊勝な心掛けね」=“Oh my, you want to carry my bags? What a commendable spirit.”
「私はそんな気分じゃないの。行くなら一人で行ってきなさい」=“I'm not even remotely in the mood for that. Go by yourself.”
「これから買い物をするから、貴方は荷物持ちをしなさい」=“I'm going shopping, so carry my bags.”
「いい返事ね。それじゃあ行くわよ」=“Good answer. We're going, then.”
「そう……家畜には、荷物持ちなんて仕事は、文字通り荷が重かったってことね」=“I see... for livestock like you, it really would be too heavy a burden, huh?”
「[H名]さんと一緒に遊びたいな」=“I wanna have some fun with you, [H名].”
「はぁ……仕方ないわね。いいわ、貴方で遊んであげる」=“Haah... it can't be helped. Sure, I'll 'have some fun' with you.”
「ひとり遊び、得意でしょう？　あっちでやってなさい。付き合うつもりはないわ」=“You're good at playing with yourself, no? Do it over there. Don't involve me.”
「退屈だから、貴方で遊んであげるわ。光栄に思いなさい」=“I'm bored, so I'll play around with you. Be honoured.”
「フフッ、当然ね。さて、何をして苛めようかしら」=“Fufuh--, of course. Now then, how should I bully you today?”
「ふぅん……断るのね。折角の機会なのに、勿体ないことをしたわね」=“Hmm... a no, huh? I finally gave you a chance too, and you just wasted it.”
「これから二人で体験コーナーに行ってみない？」=“Wanna hit up the experience corner together?”
「家畜でもちゃんと出来るのか興味があるわね。付き合ってあげるわ」=“I'm pretty interested in seeing whether even livestock like you can do it, so sure.”
「いやよ。私が何にでも付き合うと思ったら大間違いよ」=“No way. If you think that I'll tag along with anything and everything then you've got another thing coming.”
「体験コーナーに行くから、付いてきなさい」=“I'm going to the experience corner, so come with me.”
「何を言ってるの？　返事は最初からイエスに決まっているわ。ほら、行くわよ」=“What are you saying? There's no other option available to you anyway. Come on, we're going.”
「家畜の分際で断るなんていい度胸ね」=“You've got some nerve declining me, as mere livestock.”
「[H名]さんと一緒にご飯を食べに行きたいんだけど、いいかな？」=“I wanna go have a meal with you, [H名], could we?”
「餌付けをした覚えはないけれど……そんなに私と一緒がいいなら仕方ないわね」=“I don't remember ever owning you or feeding you... but if you want to be with me that badly then I suppose it can't be helped.”
「卑しい貴方と違って、私はまだお腹が空いていないわ」=“Unlike your pig self, I'm still not hungry.”
「今、腹を鳴らしたのは貴方？　空腹ならちゃんと言いなさい」=“Was that your belly that just rang out? If you're hungry then say it.”
「フッ、やっぱりそうなのね。さて、どこで食べようかしら……別に貴方には聞いてないわ」=“Pff--, I knew it. Now then, where should I eat... I'm not asking you, it was rhetorical.”
「そう。別に空いてないならいいわ」=“I see. If you're not then that's that.”
「ちょっと付いてきてくれる？」=“Can you come with me for a sec?”
「ん？　どこで苛められたいの？　あまり人がいると、貴方、社会的に死ぬわよ？」=“Hm? Where would you like to be teased? You'll be committing social suicide if there's lots of people, you know?”
「何か勘違いしているようね。家畜の分際で、馴れ馴れしいのよ」=“You're misunderstanding something, aren't you? With your social standing as livestock, you're getting way too overly-familiar.”
「はぁ、下僕が変態趣味だと、飼い主の品性まで疑われるのよ？　少し控えなさい」=“Haa, if it spreads that my manservant has perverted hobbies, even I'll be drawn through the mud, as your owner. Restrain yourself a bit.”
「へぇ、そんなに私に恥をかかせたいのね……後で覚えていなさい」=“Heh, you really want to humiliate me that much, huh... Remember this for later.”
「ふっふふ、これは何の冗談？　全然笑えないわ」=“Fuffufu, what kind of a joke is this? It's not funny at all.”
「あら、躾け方を間違えたかしら？　再調教が必要ね」=“Oh my, did I get the training wrong somewhere? Looks like I need to break you in again.”
「また後でね。私のために時間を作っておきなさい」=“See you later. Make sure to carve out some time for me later.”
「その大きくしたモノ、どうして欲しい？　叩く？　踏む？　どっち？」=“That blown-up thing of yours, what would you like I do to it? Strike it? Step on it? Take your pick.”
「貴方、誰？　主に恥をかかせる下僕なんて知らないわ」=“Who are you? I don't know any manservant who brings shame to their master.”
「ご主人様の水着姿はどう？　目に焼き付けて、今日のオカズにでもしなさい」=“How do you like seeing your master in a swimsuit? Sear it into your eyes, and use it as your material for today.”
「今、私を他の女と比べたわね？　へぇ、良い身分になったじゃない」=“You compared me against other girls just now, didn't you? Heh, well aren't you in a cushy social position?”
「主を連れ回しておいて、何もありませんでは済まないわよ？」=“You can't drag your master around all over the place, and then say "Ah, it was nothing" and be done with it, you know?”
「ふふっ、面白い事を考えるわね。そんなに踏まれたいの？」=“Fufu--, You have some interesting stuff in mind. You want to be stepped on that much?”
「いい？　貴方の全ては私のもの。常に傍にいること、命令よ」=“Listen well, okay? Each and every part of you belongs to me. Always stay by my side, that's an order.”
「少し遊んであげてもいいわ。私のオモチャになりなさい」=“I don't mind playing with you for a bit. Become my plaything.”
「ふぅん、主を驚かせようとしたわけ？　身の程を教えてあげないといけないわね」=“Hmmm, were you trying to scare your master? You really need to be shown your place, huh.”
「ほら、何か面白い話でもしてみなさい。期待はしていないけどね」=“C'mon, Talk about something interesting, anything will do. I don't expect much from you though.”
「私を退屈させたら、家畜に逆戻りよ？」=“If you bore me, it's right back to being livestock for you, got it?”
「私を見つけた瞬間に笑顔を見せて……フフッ、主と会えてそんなに嬉しいの？」=“Smiling like that the moment you see me... fufuh--, are you that happy to see your master?”
「この島で楽しい思い出は出来た？」=“Have you made any fun memories here?”
「そうね……下僕が出来たのは、楽しい思い出に数えてもいいかもしれないわ」=“Let's see... I suppose I might be willing to count the memory of getting a manservant as one of the fun ones.”
「バカンスは楽しめてるし、いい思い出は出来てると思うわ」=“Well, I'm enjoying my vacation so, I do have some.”
「俺って、ずっと下僕のままなの？」=“Will I always only be a manservant to you?”
「そうよ、貴方は一生私の下僕。嬉しいでしょう？　フフッ」=“That's right, you're my manservant for life. Happy, aren't you? Fufu--”
「どうかしらね。可能性は限りなくゼロに近いと思うけど、ゼロではないわ」=“Who knows. The possibility for advancement is infinitely close to zero, but it isn't exactly zero.”
「[H名]さんって、なにか弱点とかないの？　たとえば……実は片付けが苦手とか」=“Do you really not have anything you're weak to, [H名]-san? Like... maybe you're bad at cleanup or something?”
「あったとしても、貴方には絶対弱みを見せるつもりはないわ」=“Even if I was, I would never let you of all people see it.”
「私の弱点を知ろうとするなんて、どういう魂胆かしら？　返答次第じゃ、ただでは置かないわよ？」=“What are you planning, trying to grasp my weaknesses? Depending on your answer, you won't get away scot-free, you know.”
「ご飯のときに、好きな食べ物は最初に食べる？　それとも最後に食べる？」=“When you eat, do you eat the things you like first? Or do you save them for last?”
「空腹は最高のスパイスよ？　最初に食べるに決まっているわ」=“Hunger's the best spice, you know? Of course I eat it first.”
「並んでる料理によるわね。とりあえず、出来たてが美味しいものから私は食べてるわ」=“It depends on the food in front of me. I tend to eat the things that are tastier fresh, first.”
「はぁ、成長がないわね。これだけ話してきて、まだ私の事がわからないの？」=“Haa, still no signs of maturity in you. After all we've talked about, you still don't understand anything about me, do you?”
「抱腹絶倒間違いなしの話があるんだけど……」=“I've got an anecdote that's sure to make you curl up laughing...”
「そういって面白い話が出て来た試しがないわ」=“That's never happened even once.”
「俺の話、面白くなってきた？」=“Has talking with me become interesting for you?”
「生ゴミからアメーバになったくらいかしら。ナメクジのような進化速度ね」=“I suppose it did go from the level of living trash to an amoeba. Truly a slug-like rate of evolution.”
「もし俺がミュージカルみたいに歌いながらプロボーズしてきたら、どう思う？」=“If I proposed to you singing and dancing like in a musical, what would you think of it?”
「ドン引きしながら動画を撮ってネットに晒すわ。もちろん破局よ」=“I'd be so speechless, I'd take a video of it and put it on the internet for the world to laugh at you. Of course, I'd throw you away too.”
「本気でも冗談でも、その場で別れるわ」=“I'd throw you away on the spot, whether you're being serious or not.”
「その……俺のどんな仕草にドキドキしたりする？」=“Uhm... What part of me makes your heart pound?”
「私に苛められている時の表情は、そそられるものがあるわね」=“Your expression when I bully you does tingle my heart a little bit.”
「そんなものあるわけないじゃない。貴方、もしかして自分の顔を鏡で見たことがないの？」=“Do you really think there is such a thing? Wait, have you never looked in the mirror before, is that it?”
「一日に何回『好き』って言えばいいかな？」=“How many times in a day should I say "I love you"?”
「それこそ好きなだけ言えばいいわ。ただし、口にするごとに言葉の意味が軽くなっていくことは覚えておきなさい」=“As much as you like. But remember that everytime you say it, the words lose more of their value.”
「気が済むまで言えば？　私はそんな薄っぺらい言葉で喜んだりしないわ」=“As much as you want? Words that cheap would never make me happy anyway.”
「下僕は主人と結婚できるのでしょうか？」=“Do you think a manservant can marry his master?”
「可能性はゼロではないわ。身分違いの恋なんて、よく語られる事でしょう」=“The possibility is not zero. Afterall, aren't there lots of stories about love that transcends status and rank?”
「無理ね。だって下僕ですもの。それ以上になる必要があるわ」=“No way, impossible. I mean, it's a manservant. You'd need to be more than just a manservant to do that.”
「花の種でも食べてるの？　貴方、脳内が完全にお花畑よ」=“Do you eat flower seeds or something? Your head is completely a field of flowers.”
「[H名]さんって、子供が出来たら優しくなりそうな気がするなぁ」=“You know, [H名]-san, I feel like you'd become a much gentler person once you have kids.”
「私が子煩悩になるってこと？　フッ、気持ちの悪い妄想ね」=“Me, a doting mother? Pff--, what a disgusting delusion.”
「昨日、夢に出てきた[H名]さん、すごく優しくてさ……」=“Last night, you came to me in my dreams, [H名]-san, you were so kind and gentle...”
「夢だからって、私を勝手に捏造しないで。重罪よ」=“Don't selfishly change the way I am, even if it was a dream. It's a serious crime.”
「生理って重い方？」=“Are your periods rough?”
「えぇ、そうね。生理の時は全て任せるわ、私のために良く働きなさい」=“Yes, that's right. I'll leave everything to you when my periods come about, so work hard for my sake.”
「くだらない質問ね。どうであろうと、毎日私に尽くすのが貴方の役目よ」=“That's a pointless question. No matter how rough they are, it's your duty to serve me faithfully everyday!”
「乳首って感じやすいの？」=“Are your nipples sensitive?”
「感じるわよ。そうだ、貴方も感じる事ができように、開発してあげましょうか」=“They are. That's right, shall we work on training you, so that your nipples are sensitive too?”
「感じやすいという程ではないわね。何？　何か文句があるの？」=“I wouldn't say they're overly sensitive, no. What? You have a problem with that?”
「アナルでも感じるものなのかな？」=“Are you able to feel good from even Anal?”
「アナルで感じてはいけないの？　狭い常識に捕らわれると損よ」=“Why, is it wrong to feel pleasure from it? You'll only lose out if you stick to that narrow-mindedness.”
「私ね、男のアナルを開発してみたかったのよ。フフッ、楽しみだわ」=“You know, I've always wanted to try making a man feel good from their own ass. Fufu--, I look forward to it.”
「やっぱり股間が一番感じるのかな？」=“Your crotch is your most sensitive spot, isn't it?”
「そういう所だし、下手で粗末なモノでも、多少は感じてしまうでしょうね」=“Well, it is that sort of a place, so I can more or less feel pleasure just fine, even if the thing is poor and shabby.”
「ふぅん、尿道を開発されたいという事ね？　わかったわ、準備しましょう」=“Hmmm, you're saying you want to get your urethra developed into an erogenous zone, aren't you? I understand, I'll make the arrangements.”
「貴方、私の下僕になれたからって、ちょっとはしゃぎ過ぎよ」=“You're getting a bit too carried away, just because you've become my manservant.”
「エッチする時は、優しくして欲しいなぁ……なんて」=“Would be nice if you could be gentle when we have sex...”
「嫌よ、甘えないで。貴方の泣き顔を見るのが、私の楽しみなのだから」=“No way, don't be a spoiled brat. Being able to see your crying face is what I find the most fun.”
「[H名]さんって、いい匂いするよね。嗅いでいい？」=“[H名]-san, you smell nice. Can I have a sniff?”
「は？　死ね」=“Hah? Die.”
「なぁに？　苛めて欲しい？」=“What? Want to be bullied?”
「顔色なんて窺わなくても、私の事をわかるようになりなさい」=“Become so that you don't need to sneak a peek at my expression to understand how I'm feeling.”
「貴方の顔、見飽きたわね。ちょっと叩いて、形を変えてみましょうか」=“I'm tired of looking at your face. Shall I try changing its shape with some forceful persuasion?”
「主の胸にいやらしい視線を向けるなんて、まさかないわよね～？」=“You weren't trying to direct a dirty glance to your master's chest just now, were you~?”
「そんなに胸が好きなら、貴方の胸も腫れあがるくらいに叩いてあげましょうか？」=“If you like breasts that much, shall I beat your chest as well until it swells up?”
「ほら、揉んでみる？　なんて……言うと思ったの？　ゴミクズ」=“Hey, wanna give them a rub?... Did you think I'd actually say something like that? Trash.”
「私の目を見なさい。さぁ、後はわかるわね？」=“Look me in the eyes. Now then, you know what comes next, right?”
「ん？　違うでしょ？　ほら、お手。どうしたの？　早くしなさい」=“Nn? Aren't you going to do it? Come on, your hand. What's the holdup? Do it quickly.”
「飼い犬に手を噛まれるって、こういう気分なのかしら……」=“I wonder if this feeling is what that saying, "Biting the hand that feeds", is talking about...”
「はぁ、この駄犬……待て、伏せ。いい？　少しの間、餌は抜きよ」=“Haa, this mutt... Stop, Lie down. Listen up. You're not allowed any fodder for the next little while.”
「フフッ、良い度胸ね。胸だけに？　なんて、笑い話で済むと思った？」=“Fufu-- You sure have guts. Just my chest though? Kidding, did you think you could pass it off as a joke?”
「主の体、それも胸に勝手に触るなんて……度し難い蛮行ね」=“Touching your master's body, and the chest at that, without permission... Truly an incorrigible barbarian.”
「貴方のような輩を、おっぱい星人と言うそうよ。星ごと滅びなさい」=“The term "Man from Planet Boobies" is reserved for people like you. Go burn up with your home planet.”
「頭を撫でられて、私が喜ぶと思った？　フフッ、逆よ、気持ち悪いわ」=“Did you think I'd be happy, having my head stroked? Fufu--, It's the opposite. I'm genuinely disgusted.”
「気安いのは相変わらずね。私は直せと何度も言っているわよ？」=“That casual part of you never changes, does it. How many times have I told you to fix it?”
「下僕から家畜に戻りたいの？　いいかげんにしなさい」=“You want to be demoted from my manservant to a random livestock? Quit it.”
「ふぅん、わかった。手を噛み千切って欲しいという事ね？」=“Hmm, I got it. You want your hand bitten off, don't you?”
「口の周りはデリケートなの、貴方の雑菌で汚さないでくれる？」=“The area around my mouth is pretty delicate, can you not soil it with your germs?”
「しつこい下僕ね。自分の頬でも、ずっと触っていなさい」=“What an obstinate manservant. Why don't you stroke your own cheek instead?”
「特別に忠告してあげる。誰かさんのせいで、私は今、機嫌が悪いわ」=“I'll give you some advice, just this once. Because of a certain someone, right now, I am in a very bad mood.”
「貴方、中々使えるようになってきたじゃない。やはり私の目は確かね」=“You've become quite useful, haven't you. As expected, my eyes really are good judges.”
「少し体が熱っぽいわね。下僕、もっとこっちへ来なさい。遊んであげる」=“I feel a bit feverish. Manservant, come a bit closer to me. I'll play with you.”
「ほら、もっと主人を満足させてみなさい。それが下僕の仕事よ」=“Come on, satisfy your master even more. That's your job as a manservant.”
「ねぇ下僕。主を待たせるなんて、どういうつもりかしら？」=“Hey, manservant. What were you thinking, making your master wait?”
「顔を出しなさい。ほら、古い機械と同じよ。叩けば少しはマシになるかも」=“Hold out your face. It's the same basic principle as those old machines, if I hit it, it might get better.”
「貴方、いい加減にしなさい。流石に嫌気がさしたわ。さようなら」=“Get your act together. I'm seriously fed up, honestly. Goodbye.”
「散々情けはかけてきた。そんな私の慈悲を、裏切らったのは貴方よ」=“This whole time, I've been showing you my compassion and mercy. You're the one who betrayed that mercy of mine.”
「フフッ、貴方を苛めるのが楽しくて、つい時間を忘れてしまったわ」=“Fufu--, It was so fun teasing you, I completely forgot about the time.”
「下僕、次は体を綺麗にしておきなさい。踏んで汚してあげるわ」=“Manservant, clean and doll yourself up next time. I'll trample and defile you.”
「さて。貴方の相手は終わり。ほら、足を舐めて、感謝の姿勢を見せなさい」=“Now then, this is the end of me keeping you company. Come now, lick my feet, as a show of your gratitude.”
「ふぅ……下僕の相手をして疲れたわ。肩でも揉みながら褒めたたえなさい」=“Fuuh... I'm tired of dealing with my servant all day like this. Rub my shoulders and praise my being.”
「もう時間ね。下僕と違って主は忙しいのよ」=“It's time. Unlike you, your master actually has things to do.”
「へぇ、この私より、優先するものがあると？　さぞ重要な事なのでしょうね」=“Heh, you have something that takes precedence over me? I'm certain it must be something very important then.”
「何がしたかったの？　意味不明ね」=“What did you want to do? I don't understand at all.”
「そうねぇ、してあげてもいいけど。いい声で鳴くのよ？」=“That's right, I don't mind doing that. Cry out in a nice voice for me, okay?”
「いやよ。独りで虚しく慰めてなさい」=“No way. Fool around by your pathetic lonesome.”
「体が火照ってるの、貴方の体で鎮めさせなさい。さぁ、早く」=“My body's burning up, calm it down using yours. Quickly now!”
「そう、それでいいのよ。お互い悪い話ではないでしょう？」=“That's right, Exactly. Neither of us lose out, no?”
「へぇ、女に恥をかかせるのね。貴方、いつからそんな大層な男になったの？」=“Heh, going to humiliate a woman, huh? Just when did you become such an mighty guy?”
「ここで[H名]さんとＨしたい」=“I want to have sex with you here, [H名]-san!”
「私は構わないわよ。貴方が情けない姿を晒す事になるだけだし。フフッ」=“I don't particularly mind, personally. You're the one who's going to be exposing his pathetic self to the world, afterall. Fufu--”
「貴方、性欲だけで生きてるの？　時と場所を弁えなさい」=“Do you subsist off your sex drive alone or something? Keep the time and place in mind.”
「いいわよ。大声で泣かせてあげる。誰かにみっともない姿を見てもらいましょう」=“No problem. I'll make you cry in a loud voice. Let's show your pathetic figure to someone.”
「勝手に一人で晒してなさい。下僕の露出癖に付き合う程、暇じゃないの」=“Make a show of it to the public by your lonesome. I don't have so much free time as to accompany my manservant in his exhibitionist tendencies.”
「いいわ。でも、どこへ行くかで貴方のセンスが問われているわよ？　それは分かっているのかしら？」=“Sure. But, I'm going to judge you for where we go, alright? Do you understand that?”
「下僕、島を観光するわよ」=“We're going sightseeing, manservant.”
「なにかオススメのスポットはないの？　案内しなさい」=“Don't you have anywhere you want to take me? Come on, chop chop.”
「主の言うことが聞けないなんて、生意気な下僕ね」=“Not listening to your master, someone's feeling cocky today, huh?”
「そんなにご主人様に躾けてほしかったのね。フフッ、たっぷり楽しませてあげるわ」=“You want to be disciplined by your master that badly, huh? Fufuh--, sure, I'll make this a day to remember for you.”
「お遊びの時間よ。主も付き合ってあげるわ」=“It's play time. Your master's gonna tag along today too.”
「こら、はしゃぎすぎよ。みっともないからやめなさい」=“Hey, don't go too wild. It's disgusting to look at.”
「遊ぶ必要はないということね？　じゃあ、研修旅行らしくみっちり勉強してなさい」=“So you don't need any playtime in your life, huh? Then, study like your life depends on it, it is a study tour afterall.”
「いいわ。貴方が無様に失敗する様を隣で見ていてあげる」=“Sure. I'll watch over you as you fail pathetically and make an embarrassment of yourself.”
「体験学習の時間よ。下僕ひとりじゃ難しいでしょうから、私も付き添ってあげる」=“It's time for some hands on learning. I'm sure you would never manage it all by yourself, as just a manservant, so I'll tag along too.”
「私が見ているんだから、しっかりやりなさいよ？」=“I'll be watching, so do a proper job, okay?”
「もしかして、私の前で恥をかくのが嫌だから断ったの？　情けないわね」=“Do you not want to make a joke out of yourself in front of me, is that it? How pathetic.”
「いいわ。卑しい下僕に付き合ってあげる」=“Sure. I'll keep my gross manservant company just this once.”
「そろそろ餌の時間ね。ほら、行くわよ」=“It's time to feed you. Come on, we're going.”
「頼むものは決めておきなさい。私を少しでも待たせたらお仕置きよ」=“Pick what you're going to order in advance. If you make me wait even a second, I'll punish you.”
「なに？　断食でもしてるの？　それなら、餌やりの手間が省けて助かるわ」=“What? Are you fasting, or something? That saves me the trouble of feeding you then.”
「あのさ……俺の部屋に来てくれないかな？」=“Listen... won't you come over to my room, for a bit?”
「……別にいいけれど、主を招くのだから、部屋は綺麗に片づけているのよね？」=“...Sure but, you're inviting your master over, so I'm expecting a clean and tidy room, okay?”
「付いてきてもらってもいい？」=“Can you follow me?”
「ん？　散歩して欲しいの？　面倒な駄犬ね」=“Hm? You want to be walked? What a bothersome mutt.”
「待て、伏せ。散歩の時間は私が決めるの、貴方はじっとしていなさい」=“Stop, Lay down. I'm the one who decides when to take you on a walk, all you should do is stay still.”
