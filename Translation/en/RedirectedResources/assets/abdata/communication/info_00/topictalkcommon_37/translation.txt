「いろんなアクティビティがあるからどれを回るか迷っちゃうよね」=“There's so many activities, it's hard to pick one to start with, isn't it?”
「迷った時は、気になるものを一つづつこなしていけばいいと思います」=“When you're unsure, I think it's best to just start doing all the things you want to, one by one.”
「この島を堪能するにはアクティビティの体験は必須だよね」=“We can't skip on experiencing the activities this island has to offer if we want to say we truly savoured our stay, can we?”
「はい、その通りだと思います」=“Yes, I think that's exactly it.”
「しかし、全部のアクティビティをこなすには体力必要そうだよね」=“Still, feels like experiecing all the activities on this island's gonna take quite a bit of energy, huh?”
「そうですね。しっかりと休憩を挟みながら行っていきましょう」=“Indeed. Let us make sure to take breaks as we go along them.”
「こんなアクティビティがあったらいいなってある？」=“Is there any activity you really wish they had?”
「そうですね……陸、海とあるので、空のアクティビティもあれば、でしょうか」=“Good question... they've got land based, and sea based ones so, some midair ones would complete that set, I'd say.”
「アクティビティはこの島をアピールする重要なファクターだよね」=“The activities here are what really sell this island, aren't they?”
「そうですね、この島の目玉の一つであると思います」=“Indeed, I do think they're one of the showpieces of this island.”
「この島って、ほんとアクティビティの宝庫だよね」=“This island seriously is just a treasurebox of activities to do, isn't it?”
「はい、それだけ地理的条件が揃っているということですね」=“Yes, that's just how geographically ideal this place is, isn't it?”
「自然に囲まれた場所って、気分が落ち着くよね」=“A place like this, surrounded by nature, really calms you down, doesn't it?”
「はい、ヒーリング効果があるのだと思います」=“Yes, I do think it has quite the healing effect.”
「自然が多いおかげか、何となく酸素が濃い感じがするんだよね」=“The oxygen feels really dense here somehow, doesn't it? Wonder if it's because of all the nature.”
「多くの木々が光合成を行っているからではないのでしょうか？」=“Would that not be because of all those plants and trees photosynthesizing at once?”
「この島にはどれだけの生物がいるんだろう……」=“I wonder how many different creatures exist on this island...”
「恐らく、まだ見ぬ生物も存在しているのではないかと」=“I imagine there's likely some we've never seen before as well.”
「これだけの自然があるのは水が綺麗だからか、それとも自然が多いから水が綺麗なのか……」=“Is the water here so clean because there's so much greenery, or is there all this greenery because of the clean water?”
「鶏が先か卵が先か理論、ですね」=“The chicken or the egg, huh?”
「ほんと、これだけの自然が生き残ってるってすごいよなぁ……」=“It's hard to believe how much nature is still alive and thriving here, isn't it...”
「これぞ自然の力、という所でしょうか」=“Would that be my place to say "That's the power of nature"?”
「もし、いきなりこんな自然のど真ん中でサバイバル生活をしろって言われたら俺、自信ないなぁ……」=“If we got dropped in the middle of a place like this and were told to survive, I don't think I'd be able to, honestly...”
「やはり普段の生活とかけ離れてるからでしょう。私も自信はありません」=“I wonder if it's simply too distant from our regular lives? I wouldn't bet on my own odds either.”
「綺麗な海はほんっと映えるよねぇ」=“Truly, a sea this beautiful almost looks like it glows, doesn't it?”
「はい、つい見入ってしまいます」=“Yes, it's hard to not get distracted.”
「あの波の音を聞いてると心が安らぐんだよなぁ……」=“Listening to the sound of those waves really has a way of calming your heart, doesn't it...”
「夜、寝るときに聞いていたいですね」=“Almost makes you want to listen to it at bedtime, doesn't it?”
「どこへ行ってもあの綺麗な海があるってすごいよなぁ」=“It's amazing that no matter where we go on this island, that beautiful sea is never very far, isn't it?”
「そういった海に囲まてれいるので当たり前かと」=“We're quite surrounded by that sea, so I would think that's fairly obvious.”
「どうやったらこんな綺麗な海が維持出来るんだろうなぁ」=“I wonder what it takes to keep a beautiful sea like this as pretty as it is.”
「穏やかな気候、珊瑚礁、島民の努力、と様々な要因があると思います」=“I do believe there's a whole lot of factors, like the calm climate, the coral reefs, the efforts of the locals and whatnot.”
「いい海だからこそ、サンセットの良さが際立つよね」=“It's the beauty of the sea that really makes the sunset stand out, isn't it?”
「そうですね、とてもロマンチックな雰囲気を出してくれます」=“Indeed, it does make for a very romantic atmosphere.”
「いつか、こんな綺麗な海の中で過ごせたらいいなぁ……」=“Someday, it'd be nice to spend our lives in the middle of that beautiful sea...”
「幻想的で素敵だと思います」=“I think that's very fantastical and lovely.”
「名産品となると、やっぱり全て島の物で作ってるのかな？」=“Are all the local goods made from things on this island, you think?”
「そうだと思います」=“I do think so.”
「名物になる物って、何かこう……味があるものが多いよね」=“The local specialties here, they kinda have this... like a certain style to them, you know?”
「そういった物こそ名物となる所以なのではないでしょうか」=“Isn't that exactly why they're called the local specialties of this place?”
「こういう所の名物と言えば木彫りの置物が定番だよね」=“As far as local goods go, ornamental wooden figures are pretty standard no matter where you go, aren't they?”
「そうですね、素材が多い分作りやすいのでしょうか」=“Indeed, I wonder if it's because wood is plentiful and easy to work?”
「民芸品も名物、自然やアクティビティも名物……この島にはいろんな名物があるよなぁ」=“The folk crafts are the local specialties too, and so is the nature and all the activities... this island has a whole lot of specialties, doesn't it?”
「それだけこの島全体が素晴らしいという事でしょう」=“I suppose that's just how wonderful this island is.”
「こういった名物って外の世界には出さないものなのかな？」=“I wonder if they go out of their way to not sell the local specialities here in the outside world?”
「この島でしかない、という価値があってこその代物ではないでしょうか」=“Is there value not mostly tied to the fact that they're available only here?”
「名物になるものって、やっぱりこの島の歴史を物語ってるものから来てるのかな」=“I wonder, you think the things that eventually become specialities all start off as things that tell some sort of this island's history?”
「恐らくは。後世に残すための意味合いもあるのではないでしょうか」=“In all likelihood. I imagine they might also serve as to leave some of that history for the future generations.”
「旅行へ行くとエッチな気分になりやすいのは何でだろうなぁ……」=“I wonder why people get into lewd moods so much more easily when they're out on vacation...”
「身も心もアクティブになっているからではないでしょうか？」=“Is it not perhaps because both their hearts and bodies are active?”
「色々動いて疲れてるはずなのに、エッチな気分だけは治まらないんだよなぁ」=“Even though I should be tired from all the running around, my libido's the one thing that won't settle down, you know~?”
「それは生物的に生殖本能が働いているからだと思います」=“I do think that's your reproductive urges at work.”
「[H名]もこういった所だと気分が盛り上がったりする？」=“Does being in places like these fire you up as well, [H]?”
「はい。相手が目の前にいれば尚更です」=“Yes. Especially if my partner's right in front of me.”
「そのような込み入った話はまた後程」=“Let's talk about such things later.”
「卑猥なお話ですね」=“How lewd.”
