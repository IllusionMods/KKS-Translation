「<color\=yellow>シュノーケリング</color>ってなかなか楽しいわね」=“<color\=yellow>Snorkeling</color> is pretty darn fun, huh?”
「水が綺麗だから、海の中が本当に素敵なのよ」=“The water's really clean here, so it's really wonderful under the sea.”
「<color\=yellow>トレッキング</color>って気持ちいいわよね」=“<color\=yellow>Trekking</color> feels great, doesn't it?”
「自然に包まれてのんびりできるあの感覚、普段は味わえないわ」=“That sensation of relaxing within the arms of nature is something you can't savour normally.”
「なるほど、そっちも楽しそうね」=“I see, that sounds fun as well.”
「わかるわ。それも試してみたいわね」=“I feel you. I want to try that out too.”
「そう、あまり好きじゃなさそうね。試してみたら変わるかも知れないわよ」=“I see, seems that you're not that into it. Who knows, you might change your mind if you try it.”
「あまりお気に召さなかったみたいね。食わず嫌いは良くないわよ」=“Seems like it doesn't really do anything for you, huh? Being picky without trying even a bite is not a good habit, you know?”
「<color\=yellow>水牛</color>ってよく見たら可愛いわよね」=“<color\=yellow>Water buffalos</color> are actually really cute up close, aren't they?”
「あののんびりした歩みを見ていると、時間がゆっくり流れてるような気がするわ」=“When I look at them walking at their slow gait, it feels like time itself is flowing slower.”
「<color\=yellow>マングローブ</color>って、不思議な魅力があるわよね」=“<color\=yellow>Mangroves</color> have a really mystical charm to them, don't they?”
「マングローブって名前の木があるわけじゃないのよ。汽水域の植物群落をそう呼ぶみたい」=“It's not like there's a specific tree with that name, you know. Apparently, all plants that grow in brackish waters are grouped together as mangroves.”
「<color\=yellow>パワースポット</color>ってなんだか神秘的よね」=“<color\=yellow>Powerspots</color> feel somehow mystical, don't they?”
「私はオカルトを否定するつもりはないわ。私達が知りえない力だって確かに存在するはずよ」=“I have no intention of denying the existence of the occult. There's no way to deny that there might be some power out there that we just can't measure.”
「この島の<color\=yellow>星空</color>は、本当に素晴らしいわ」=“<color\=yellow>The starry night sky</color> in this place really is wonderful, isn't it?”
「周りに光が少なくて、星がはっきりと見えるのよ。自然が豊かなおかげだわ」=“It's because there's not many lights around here, that we can see the stars so clearly. So really, it's thanks to all the nature.”
「なるほど、そういう見方もできるのね」=“I see, you can see it that way as well, huh?”
「そんな魅力もあったなんて、気が付かなかったわ」=“I didn't realize that there was that sort of a charm to it too.”
「あなたの嗜好を否定するつもりはないわ。でも、一度ちゃんと見てみる事をおススメするわ」=“I have no intention of denying your own preferences. Though, I would recommend trying it atleast once.”
「わかってるわ、ただ興味がわかないだけなんでしょ。私の説得力が足らなかったのかしら？」=“I know, you simply don't feel interested, right? Was I simply lacking in persuasiveness?”
「やっぱり<color\=yellow>サンゴ</color>礁は素敵よね」=“<color\=yellow>Coral</color> reefs really are wonderful, aren't they?”
「それ自体、カラフルで綺麗だし、何より周りの水を綺麗している所がすごいわ」=“They themselves are so colorful and pretty, yet they clean up the water around them too, it's just amazing.”
「<color\=yellow>クマノミ</color>って、とても可愛いと思わない？」=“Don't you think <color\=yellow>clownfish</color> are just adorable?”
「イソギンチャクと共生している所とか、すごく愛らしいと思うわ」=“The way they co-exist with their anemone homes is just lovely I think.”
「いいわね、それも素敵だわ」=“Nice, that sounds wonderful too.”
「私にもわかるわ。確かに良さそうね」=“I can understand it. That does sound nice.”
「そこには興味がないのね？　残念だわ、もう少し見てもらえばわかると思うけど」=“You're not very interested in that, are you? That's a shame, I think you'd understand too, if you simply looked at it a bit more.”
「あら、わかってくれないのね？　アナタになら、きっと良さが伝わると思ったんだけど」=“Oh my, you can't see the goodness of it, huh? I really thought you of all people would, too.”
「やっぱり、<color\=yellow>名物料理</color>は押さえておくべきでしょ」=“I suppose we ought to sample the <color\=yellow>local cuisine</color> as well.”
「何事も経験よ。それに美味しく食べられるなら、一石二鳥だわ」=“Everything's an experience. And if it's delicious to boot then it'd just be two birds with one stone.”
「<color\=yellow>紅型</color>染めって、本当に奇麗よね」=“<color\=yellow>Stencil dyeing</color> makes for some really pretty stuff, doesn't it?”
「伝統文化と、現代のデザインが見事に融合していて、本当に見ていて飽きないわ」=“The blend of traditional techniques and modern designs makes for such amazing stuff, I really can never get tired of looking at stuff made with it.”
「いいわね、そっちも素敵だと思うわ」=“Nice, I think that's wonderful as well.”
「さすがね、いい着眼点だわ」=“I'm impressed, you have quite the way of looking at things.”
「ちょっと、難しかったのかしら？　分かってもらえると思ったのだけど」=“Hey, was it difficult to understand? I really thought I'd be able to get it across too.”
「難しいのね。わかってもらえないのが、こんなに悔しいなんて……」=“It's hard to understand, huh? I can't believe not being able to express something, would be this frustrating...”
