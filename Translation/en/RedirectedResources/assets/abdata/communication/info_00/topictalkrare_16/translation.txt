「ホエールウォッチングって興味ある？」=“Are you interested in whale watching?”
「観光地へ旅行に来ていて、『ない』と言うような人間ではありたくないわ」=“I don't want to be the kind of person who travels to a tourist spot, and then doesn't do anything.”
「あるってことだよね？　俺も同じ」=“You mean you are, right?　Me, too.”
「アナタの言う興味って？　一度、実際に見てみたい、という感じかしら」=“So what's your interest in them? I suppose I'd like to see them in person.”
「まあ、そんなものかな。でっかいなーってなりそう」=“Well, something like that. Seems like they're going to be really big.”
「そう思っていたら意外と小さく映るかもしれないわよ？　百聞は一見にしかず……いい言葉ね」=“If that's what you're thinking, you might be surprised at how small they look, you know? Seeing is believing... is a good saying.”
「ヤシガニってちょっと怖いよね」=“Palm crabs are a little scary.”
「よくない話を聞くものね。意外と獰猛とか、雑食とか……」=“I've heard some bad things about them. Surprisingly fierce, they'll eat anything...”
「木登りもするんだってよ？」=“And did you know they also climb trees?”
「それ、怖い要素に入ってくるの？」=“Isn't that just another thing that makes them scary?”
「どこまでも追い詰めてやるぜ、みたいな？」=“Like the whole 'I will hunt you down, no matter where you go' factor?”
「アナタって想像力豊かなのね。楽しそうで何よりだわ」=“You have such a vivid imagination. Glad you're having fun.”
「どうも。って、今のは褒め言葉でいいんだよね？」=“Thanks. Hey, you just complimented me right now, didn't you?”
「月桃ってキレイな花だよね」=“Shell ginger has quite the beautiful flowers, doesn't it?”
「ええ、でも香りは少し癖があるかしら？　初めて嗅いだ時は戸惑ったわ」=“Ehh, but the scent's kinda peculiar, you know?　I was a little confused when I first smelled it.”
「香草だったっけ？　ああいう感じだよね」=“It's a fragrant herb.　That's what it smells like.”
「実際、ハーブの一種みたいだし、間違っていないわね」=“Actually, it seems that it's a variety of herb, so you're not wrong.”
「そうえいば、防虫効果もあるそうよ」=“And by the way, I've heard it's also an insect repellent.”
「……あれ？　今、悪い虫扱いされた気がするんだけど」=“...really?　I feel like I'm being treated like a bad bug right now.”
「ヤマネコって可愛いよね。一度、だっこしてみたいかも」=“Wildcats are so cute, aren't they? I'd like to try holding one.”
「引っかかれるわよ？　いいえ、引っ掻くどころか……」=“You'll get scratched, you know?　No, instead of scratching you...”
「ガブッ、かな」=“Bite, maybe.”
「肉食だもの。わかってて言ったの？」=“They're carnivores. You know that, right?”
「可愛さに罪はないから」=“Cuteness is innocence.”
「それは否定しないわ。私だって当然、可愛いものは好きよ」=“I don't deny that. I like cute things too, of course.”
「そっか。じゃあ今度一緒にヤマネコグッズを探してみる？」=“I see. Then, would you like to go look for wildcat souvenirs some time?”
「何が『じゃあ』なのか分からないけど……悪い提案じゃないわね」=“I don't know what you mean by 'then', but... that's not a bad idea.”
「この辺りは流れ星が有名なんだよ」=“This area is famous for shooting stars.”
「知っているわ。生憎、私はまだ見たことがないのだけれど」=“I know. Unforunately, I haven't seen any yet.”
「時期がいいと雨みたいに降ってくるから、そんなに流れてたら……」=“Well the time's right, there will be so many, they'll fall like rain...”
「お願いごとをし放題？」=“Can I make all the wishes I want?”
「バレたか」=“You got me.”
「フフッ、アナタってたまに子供みたいなことを言うわね」=“Huhu, you sound like such a child sometimes, you know?”
「たとえばどんなお願いごとをするのかしら？」=“What kind of wishes would you make?”
「もしかして、流れ星の代わりに叶えてくれるの？」=“Maybe you could make them happen, instead of the shooting star?”
「そんなわけないでしょ。神様やお星さまに縋ることは否定しないけど、ちゃんと努力はするべきよ」=“No, that's not possible. I don't deny that we should put our faith in God and the stars, but we should make a proper effort.”
「はい、すいません」=“Yes, sorry.”
「サガリバナにロマンを感じる？」=“You the sagaribana is romantic?”
「そうね。進化の過程は気になるわ。どうして一晩で咲いて散ってしまうのか――」=“Yes, I do. I'm curious about their evolutionary process. Why does it bloom and wild overnight--”
「えぇと、そういうこじゃなくて……」=“Ehhh, that's not what I meant...”
「今のは私なりの冗談よ。まぁ、気になるのは本当だけれど」=“That was just my own little joke. Well, it's true that I'm curious, though.”
「……一度は、この目で見てみたいわね。写真で見た花はどれも綺麗だったもの」=“...I'd like to see it once, with my own eyes. All the flowers I've seen in pictures are so beautiful.”
「咲く瞬間も、散った花が水面に漂う姿も……筆舌に尽くしがたかったわ」=“That moment it bloomed, and the picture of the scattered flowers, floating on water... it was beyond description.”
「最近覗いてた鳥の巣で、雛が孵ってたんだ」=“I was recently watching a bird's nest, and the chicks had hatched.”
「アナタってここでの生活を全力で楽しんでるのね」=“You're really enjoying your life here as much as you can, aren't you?”
「そう言われると、はいとしか」=“When you put it that way, I can only say yes.”
「ごめんなさい、バカにしたわけじゃないの。行動力があるなって……本当よ？」=“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make fun of you. You really are a man of action... aren't you?”
「アナタのその積極性は、見習わないといけないと思っているわ」=“I think I need to learn from your positive attitude.”
「いやいや、俺はせっかく来たから全力で楽しんでるだけだよ」=“No, no, I'm just here to enjoy myself as much as I can.”
「そういうところを褒めているのだけど……アナタにとってはそれが当たり前のことなのね」=“That's what I'm complimenting you for, but... I guess that's just the way you are, you know?”
「俺が世話してたアサガオが、やっと花を咲かせたんだ」=“That morning glory I've been taking care of has finally bloomed.”
「世話をしていたって……それ、いつの話なの？」=“So, you say you've been taking care of it... when was that happening?”
「ここ最近かな。ずっと水をあげてた甲斐あって、綺麗に咲いてくれたよ」=“Just recently, I guess. I was worth spending all that time watering them, since they bloomed beautifully.”
「本当に行動力あるわね、アナタって」=“You're quite the man of action.”
「行動力っていうほどじゃないよ。ただ何となく育ててただけだし」=“Not so much. I just ended up growing them.”
「普通、旅先でアサガオを育てようなんて思わないわ」=“People don't usually think of growing morning glories while on vacation.”
「……俺、変かな？」=“...am I weird?”
「私が言えたことじゃないけど変ね。でも、好ましく思うわ」=“It's not my place to say... but you're weird. I like that, though.”
「マンタってなんでマンタっていうか知ってる？」=“Do you know why manta rays are called manta rays?”
「マントでしょ。正式な名前はオニイトマキエイ。もしくはナンヨウマンタね」=“It's that cape. The official name is onyx ray. Or south-sea ray.”
「……正解」=“...right answer.”
「あ、ごめんなさい。知らないふりをしておけばよかったかしら？」=“Ah, sorry. Should I have pretended I didn't know?”
「そういう気遣いは要らないです」=“I don't require that kind of attention.”
「拗ねないで。えーと、私が知らなくて、アナタが知っていそうなことは……」=“Don't sulk. Er, um... what is there that I don't know, that you might...”
「……無理しなくていいよ？　俺も思いつかないし」=“...you don't have to do that, okay?　I can't think of anything, either.”
「海ほたるって、キラキラして宝石みたいだよね」=“Sea fireflies are like sparkling jewels, aren't they?”
「そう？　キラキラしてるのは認めるけど、もっと落ち着いた光じゃないかしら」=“How's that?　I agree they're sparkly, but I think it's a more subdued light.”
「イルミネーションというか……いえ、それだと宝石より明るいわね」=“More like a lamp light... no, then that would make it brighter than jewels.”
「まぁ、灯りそのものと、鉱石の光沢だもんね」=“Well, it's the light itself, and the luster of the jewels.”
「……他に例えが思いつかないわ。悔しいけれど、アナタの方が一枚上手だったみたい」=“...I can't think of any other analogy. How frustrating... looks like you're better than me at this.”
「別に勝負をしていたつもりはないけど……」=“I wasn't trying to be competitive...”
「この辺りではウミガメが見られるんだよ」=“You can see sea turtles around here.”
「産卵シーズンだし、時期もよかったわね」=“It's spawning season. You're in the right place at the right time.”
「今って産卵シーズンなの？」=“It's spawning season?”
「知ってて言ったんじゃなかったの？　基本的に夏の時期よ」=“I thought you said you knew.　It's basically summer time.”
「いやー、ウミガメが見れるってだけでワクワクしてさ。よく調べてはなかったんだよ」=“No, I was just excited to see sea turtles. I really didn't research it.
「ふぅん。もしかして、アナタってカメが好きなの？」=“Hmph. I guess you like turtles?”
「好きというか……背中に乗ってみたいって憧れはあるかな」=“I'm not saying I love them... but I guess I've always wanted to ride on their backs.”
「おとぎ話じゃないんだから」=“This isn't a fairytale.”
「子供だなーって顔しないでよ。男ってみんなそんなもんだよ」=“Don't look at me like I'm a child. All guys are like that.”
「『みんな』は主語が大きすぎじゃないかしら」=“I think "all" is an overstatement.”
「星の砂って、この辺りのお土産では定番の人気商品らしいよ。確かに綺麗だし、納得だよね」=“I heard that star sand's a popular souvenir around here. It makes sense - it is beautiful.”
「……まさかとは思うけど、本当にお星さまの砂だとは思ってないわよね？」=“...I'm thinking you don't, but you don't really think it's made of stars, do you?”
「いやいや、流石にそれはないよ。あれは生き物の殻でしょ？」=“No, no, I don't. It's the shell of a living creature, isn't it?”
「そう、有孔虫の殻よ」=“Yes, it's a foraminifera shell.”
「殻っていうとあれだけど、人の手が加えられてないのに自然と星みたいな形になるのって、ロマンがあるよね」=“It's just a shell, but there's something romantic about that natural star-shape, without having been touched by human hands.”
「ロマン、ね。フフっ、その通りだわ。私もひとつ買っておこうかしら」=“Romantic, huh. Huhu! You're right. Maybe I should buy some.”
「ウムイの鐘ってどうやって始まったんだろうね？」=“Ever wonder how the whole Umui Bell thing got started?”
「さぁ……？　不意打ち過ぎてよく分からないというのが本音だわ」=“Sooo...?　I don't know... you sprang that one me pretty suddenly.”
「バレンタインデーはお菓子会社の策略らしいけど」=“I've heard that Valentine's Day is a scheme came up with by the candy companies.”
「ウムイの鐘は観光会社の策略なの？」=“So the Umui Bell is a tourist agency scheme?”
「策略はおかしいな。ごめん、ちょっと気になっちゃって」=“That's one crazy tactic. Sorry, I was just a little curious.”
「バレンタインと同じよ。事のきっかけがどうでも、気持ちを伝える口実になればいいじゃない」=“So, it's just like Valentine'd Day, then. It doesn't matter how it got started. They're both great excuses to tell someone how you feel.”
「まぁ……たしかにそうかもね」=“Well... you're probably right.”
「おっぱい大好きな男のこと、どう思う？」=“So, what do you think about guys who are crazy about boobs?”
「えっと……それは予防線を引いてるの？」=“Er, um... should I be taking precautions?”
「なんとういうか、単純に興味があっただけで……深い意味はないかな」=“I'm just curious, for some reason... there's no deep meaning behind it.”
「そ、そう……まあ、強いて言うなら……少しバカみたい……ってところかしら」=“S-so... well, if I had to say... that seems a little silly... I guess that's all.”
「逆に聞きたいんだけれど、おっぱいってそれほど魅力があるの？」=“But I have to ask - are boobs really all that attractive?”
「もちろん！　見てよし触ってよし舐めて……あ、なるほど。これはバカだね」=“Of course!　Looking at them, touching them, licking them... ah, I get it. This is silly.”
「千差万別の性癖、つまるところのフェチってどう思う？」=“What do you think about all those sexual proclivities... or fetishes, as they're called?”
「……フェチと言いさえすればなんでも正当化できる風潮には不満があるわ」=“I'm not happy with the way everything's justified, as long as you can classify it as a fetish.”
「正当化が成立してるかともかく、言いたいことはわかるかも」=“Whether it's a valid justification or not, I think you maybe get my point.”
「サドとか好例ね。ただ、暴力を振るうのが好きな自分を肯定させたいだけじゃない」=“Sado (S) is a good example. It's not just about them justifying their love of violence.”
「でも、殴られて興奮する相手がいるからプレイとして成立してる部分もあるし」=“It's partly just play, because there's also a partner who gets off on being hit. That's what makes it work.”
「そうかもねと私が肯定したら、何をするつもりなの……？」=“So, if I justify that you may be right, what are you planning on doing...?”
「ただの雑談だから！」=“We're just chatting?”
「欲求不満ってヤバいよね？　心が獣になるっていうか」=“Frustration's a bad thing, isn't it?　It's like you turn into an animal.”
「……真顔でそんなことを言われると同意できるわね」=“...I can agree with you, when you say things like that with such a straight face.”
「欲求不満になったことない人ってこの世にいるの？」=“Is there anyone in the world who's never been frustrated?”
「そ、それは……いるはずよ。だって、アナタはエッチな意味で言ってのでしょう？」=“Th-that's so... I suppose. But, you mean sexually, don't you?”
「そうだよ。今もちょっときてるし」=“That's right. I'm experiencing a little of it, right now.”
「な、何を言っているの……？　今のは聞かなかったことにするわ！」=“What are you saying...?　I'm just gonna pretend I didn't hear that!”
「あのさ……初めてシたときのことなんだけど……どうだった？」=“So, uh... the first time we had sex... how was it?”
「それは……ず、随分と急な話ね……どうしてそんなことを聞くの？」=“That's... v-very sudden... why are you asking me that?”
「あの後、全然そんな話題にならなかったから気になって……」=“I was just curious, because we didn't talk about it at all after we did it.”
「……もしかして、怒ってるとでも思った？　そんなことはないから安心して」=“...are you maybe thinking I'm mad at you? Don't worry, that's not true.”
「ただ……照れ臭かっただけよ。私だって女の子だから」=“I was just... embarrassed. I mean, I am a girl.”
「そっか……それなら良かった」=“I see... good to know.”
「……気恥ずかしいから、もうこの話は終わりにしていいかしら？」=“...this is so embarrassing, so can we just move on now?”
「う、うん……そうだね」=“Y-yeah... right.”
