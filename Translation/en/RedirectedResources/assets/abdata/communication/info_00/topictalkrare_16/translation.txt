「ホエールウォッチングって興味ある？」=“Got any interest in whale watching?”
「観光地へ旅行に来ていて、『ない』と言うような人間ではありたくないわ」=“I'd rather not believe that there're people out there who'd come to a vacation island like this and say "no" to that question.”
「あるってことだよね？　俺も同じ」=“So you do, right? Same here.”
「アナタの言う興味って？　一度、実際に見てみたい、という感じかしら」=“Interest, as you say? I just want to see them once with my own eyes, I suppose.”
「まあ、そんなものかな。でっかいなーってなりそう」=“Well, I guess that works. I feel like I'm gonna end up going "it's huge!" when I see it.”
「そう思っていたら意外と小さく映るかもしれないわよ？　百聞は一見にしかず……いい言葉ね」=“It might actually turn out to be rather small, you know? Seeing is believing... truly.”
「ヤシガニってちょっと怖いよね」=“Coconut crabs are a bit scary, aren't they?”
「よくない話を聞くものね。意外と獰猛とか、雑食とか……」=“You hear a lot of bad things, don't you? Stuff like how they're so ferocious, and how they're carnivores...”
「木登りもするんだってよ？」=“They can even climb trees, you know?”
「それ、怖い要素に入ってくるの？」=“What's scary about that?”
「どこまでも追い詰めてやるぜ、みたいな？」=“I guess they could chase you up one? Or anywhere, for that matter.”
「アナタって想像力豊かなのね。楽しそうで何よりだわ」=“You've got a really active imagination, don't you? Well I'm glad you know how to enjoy yourself.”
「どうも。って、今のは褒め言葉でいいんだよね？」=“Thanks. That was a compliment, right?”
「月桃ってキレイな花だよね」=“Shell gingers make for some really pretty flowers, don't they?”
「ええ、でも香りは少し癖があるかしら？　初めて嗅いだ時は戸惑ったわ」=“Yes, but their scent is a bit unique, I'd say? It was really perplexing the first time I smelled one.”
「香草だったっけ？　ああいう感じだよね」=“A fragrant grass, was it? It definitely does have that feeling to it, doesn't it?”
「実際、ハーブの一種みたいだし、間違っていないわね」=“Well, it is apparently a herb so, you're not wrong.”
「そうえいば、防虫効果もあるそうよ」=“Reminds me, seems like it makes for good insect repellant too.”
「……あれ？　今、悪い虫扱いされた気がするんだけど」=“...Huh? I feel like you just called me an insect there.”
「ヤマネコって可愛いよね。一度、だっこしてみたいかも」=“Wildcats are really cute, aren't they? I think I wanna try cuddling one, just once.”
「引っかかれるわよ？　いいえ、引っ掻くどころか……」=“You'll get clawed, you know? No, forget being clawed...”
「ガブッ、かな」=“Will it bite me, you think?”
「肉食だもの。わかってて言ったの？」=“Well, it's a carnivore. Did you say that knowing that?”
「可愛さに罪はないから」=“It's not a sin to find things cute.”
「それは否定しないわ。私だって当然、可愛いものは好きよ」=“I won't deny that. I like cute things too, of course.”
「そっか。じゃあ今度一緒にヤマネコグッズを探してみる？」=“I see. Then, wanna go look at some wildcat merch together sometime?”
「何が『じゃあ』なのか分からないけど……悪い提案じゃないわね」=“I'm not sure where that "then" came from but... not the worst idea, no.”
「この辺りは流れ星が有名なんだよ」=“The shooting stars here are very famous.”
「知っているわ。生憎、私はまだ見たことがないのだけれど」=“I know. Sadly, I have not seen any myself just yet.”
「時期がいいと雨みたいに降ってくるから、そんなに流れてたら……」=“Apparently they fall like rain if the time is right, imagine that many falling at once...”
「お願いごとをし放題？」=“You'd wish for the world, wouldn't you?”
「バレたか」=“Saw right through me, huh?”
「フフッ、アナタってたまに子供みたいなことを言うわね」=“Fufuh--, you really are like just a child sometimes, you know?”
「たとえばどんなお願いごとをするのかしら？」=“What would you wish for though, exactly?”
「もしかして、流れ星の代わりに叶えてくれるの？」=“What, you'll make come true for me?”
「そんなわけないでしょ。神様やお星さまに縋ることは否定しないけど、ちゃんと努力はするべきよ」=“No way. I'm not going to tell you off for clinging to the stars and the gods and whatnot but, you need to put your own effort into things, you know.”
「はい、すいません」=“Yes, I do apologize.”
「サガリバナにロマンを感じる？」=“Do you feel any charm within mango pines?”
「そうね。進化の過程は気になるわ。どうして一晩で咲いて散ってしまうのか――」=“Yeah. I do feel pretty curious about their evoluton. Just why do they bloom for exactly one night before they wither--”
「えぇと、そういうこじゃなくて……」=“Erhm, that's not what I meant...”
「今のは私なりの冗談よ。まぁ、気になるのは本当だけれど」=“That was a joke on my part. Well, it's true that I am curious.”
「……一度は、この目で見てみたいわね。写真で見た花はどれも綺麗だったもの」=“...I'd like to see them with my own eyes, one of these days. The photos I've seen were all very pretty.”
「咲く瞬間も、散った花が水面に漂う姿も……筆舌に尽くしがたかったわ」=“The sight of them blooming, and the sight of withered ones floating away on water as well... I don't even have words.”
「最近覗いてた鳥の巣で、雛が孵ってたんだ」=“This birds' nest I've been watching over, finally had the egg in it hatch.”
「アナタってここでの生活を全力で楽しんでるのね」=“You really are enjoying life here, aren't you?”
「そう言われると、はいとしか」=“I mean, I guess.”
「ごめんなさい、バカにしたわけじゃないの。行動力があるなって……本当よ？」=“I'm sorry, I didn't mean that as a slight. I just thought you're very driven... I mean it, you know?”
「アナタのその積極性は、見習わないといけないと思っているわ」=“I do feel I should learn a thing or two from you, in that regard.”
「いやいや、俺はせっかく来たから全力で楽しんでるだけだよ」=“No no, a trip like this isn't something you get to go on everyday, so I'm just making the best of it, really.”
「そういうところを褒めているのだけど……アナタにとってはそれが当たり前のことなのね」=“But that's what I'm complimenting though... I suppose to you, it comes as naturally as breathing, huh?”
「俺が世話してたアサガオが、やっと花を咲かせたんだ」=“This morning glory I've been caring for finally bloomed.”
「世話をしていたって……それ、いつの話なの？」=“You've been caring for one of those?... When was this?”
「ここ最近かな。ずっと水をあげてた甲斐あって、綺麗に咲いてくれたよ」=“These past few days, really. I've been watering it for the longest time so, it bloomed into a really pretty flower for me.”
「本当に行動力あるわね、アナタって」=“You really do have a lot of drive, don't you?”
「行動力っていうほどじゃないよ。ただ何となく育ててただけだし」=“Eh, not that much. I just ended up taking care of it.”
「普通、旅先でアサガオを育てようなんて思わないわ」=“I don't think normal people go out of their way to take care of flowers when they're on trips.”
「……俺、変かな？」=“...Am I weird?”
「私が言えたことじゃないけど変ね。でも、好ましく思うわ」=“I'm not one to be saying it, but you are. But I think it's a likeable part of you.”
「マンタってなんでマンタっていうか知ってる？」=“Do you know why mantas are called mantas?”
「マントでしょ。正式な名前はオニイトマキエイ。もしくはナンヨウマンタね」=“Because of mantles, no? Their proper name is great oceanic manta ray. They're also called reef manta rays.”
「……正解」=“...Correct.”
「あ、ごめんなさい。知らないふりをしておけばよかったかしら？」=“Ah, I'm sorry. Should I have pretended to not know it?”
「そういう気遣いは要らないです」=“You need not be so considerate on my account.”
「拗ねないで。えーと、私が知らなくて、アナタが知っていそうなことは……」=“Now now, don't sulk. Erhm, there's surely things you know that I don't, like...”
「……無理しなくていいよ？　俺も思いつかないし」=“...You really don't need to force yourself to try, you know? I can't think of anything either.”
「海ほたるって、キラキラして宝石みたいだよね」=“With how much they glitter, sea fireflies almost look like gems, don't they?”
「そう？　キラキラしてるのは認めるけど、もっと落ち着いた光じゃないかしら」=“You think? I won't deny that they glitter but, their light is a whole lot more subdued, no?”
「イルミネーションというか……いえ、それだと宝石より明るいわね」=“Compared to LED lights... no, those are a lot brighter than gems, aren't they?”
「まぁ、灯りそのものと、鉱石の光沢だもんね」=“Well, yeah. One's light itself, and the other's the luster from minerals.”
「……他に例えが思いつかないわ。悔しいけれど、アナタの方が一枚上手だったみたい」=“...I can't think of a good example. It's frustrating to admit, but it seems that your example was a step better than mine.”
「別に勝負をしていたつもりはないけど……」=“I wasn't trying to compete with you or anything there though...”
「この辺りではウミガメが見られるんだよ」=“We can see sea turtles around these parts, you know.”
「産卵シーズンだし、時期もよかったわね」=“It's egg laying season for them too, so we came at a good time.”
「今って産卵シーズンなの？」=“It is?”
「知ってて言ったんじゃなかったの？　基本的に夏の時期よ」=“I thought you knew, since you brought it up? It usually lands during summer.”
「いやー、ウミガメが見れるってだけでワクワクしてさ。よく調べてはなかったんだよ」=“No well~, I was excited just to see a sea turtle itself. I didn't actually look into it.”
「ふぅん。もしかして、アナタってカメが好きなの？」=“Hmm. Do you like turtles, by any chance?”
「好きというか……背中に乗ってみたいって憧れはあるかな」=“I do, or rather... part of me does want to try riding one if I can.”
「おとぎ話じゃないんだから」=“We don't live in a fairy tale, you know.”
「子供だなーって顔しないでよ。男ってみんなそんなもんだよ」=“Don't look at me like an overgrown kid. All men are like this.”
「『みんな』は主語が大きすぎじゃないかしら」=“Half the human race is too many, no?”
「星の砂って、この辺りのお土産では定番の人気商品らしいよ。確かに綺麗だし、納得だよね」=“Seems like starsand is a pretty popular souvenir around these parts. It is definitely very pretty, so I can see why too.”
「……まさかとは思うけど、本当にお星さまの砂だとは思ってないわよね？」=“...I don't think even you're that far gone, but you don't think it's actually sand from an actual star, right?”
「いやいや、流石にそれはないよ。あれは生き物の殻でしょ？」=“No way, have some faith. It's just husks from dead microorganisms, right?”
「そう、有孔虫の殻よ」=“That's right, specifically Foraminifer husks.”
「殻っていうとあれだけど、人の手が加えられてないのに自然と星みたいな形になるのって、ロマンがあるよね」=“Calling it what it actually is does take away from it but, it's pretty romantic how they just naturally ended up taking a star shape without any human intervention whatsoever, isn't it?”
「ロマン、ね。フフっ、その通りだわ。私もひとつ買っておこうかしら」=“Romantic, huh? Fufuh--, it really is. Maybe I'll buy a capsule too.”
「ウムイの鐘ってどうやって始まったんだろうね？」=“I wonder how the legend of the Bell of Umuy started to begin with?”
「さぁ……？　不意打ち過ぎてよく分からないというのが本音だわ」=“I don't know...? That's so out of the blue I honestly have nothing for you.”
「バレンタインデーはお菓子会社の策略らしいけど」=“I mean, wasn't Valentines' Day cooked up by Big Candy?”
「ウムイの鐘は観光会社の策略なの？」=“So is the Bell of Umuy a scheme by Big Tourism then?”
「策略はおかしいな。ごめん、ちょっと気になっちゃって」=“That'd be pretty funny. Sorry, I just got a bit curious.”
「バレンタインと同じよ。事のきっかけがどうでも、気持ちを伝える口実になればいいじゃない」=“It's the same as Valentines'. It doesn't matter how it started off, it's a good enough excuse for couples to show their love for one another.”
「まぁ……たしかにそうかもね」=“Well... you're not wrong there.”
「おっぱい大好きな男のこと、どう思う？」=“What do you think of men, that love boobs?”
「えっと……それは予防線を引いてるの？」=“Erhm... are you trying to gauge my reaction ahead of time?”
「なんとういうか、単純に興味があっただけで……深い意味はないかな」=“No I just felt a bit curious, really... I don't mean anything deep by it.”
「そ、そう……まあ、強いて言うなら……少しバカみたい……ってところかしら」=“I-I see... well, if I did have to come up with something... it feels a bit stupid... I suppose?”
「逆に聞きたいんだけれど、おっぱいってそれほど魅力があるの？」=“Really, I want to ask you instead. Are boobs that appealing to you?”
「もちろん！　見てよし触ってよし舐めて……あ、なるほど。これはバカだね」=“Of course! You can lick them, touch them, lick them all ov--... ah, I see. That is a bit stupid, isn't it?”
「千差万別の性癖、つまるところのフェチってどう思う？」=“What do you think of all the thousands of fetishes and kinks out there?”
「……フェチと言いさえすればなんでも正当化できる風潮には不満があるわ」=“...I don't think well of them, certainly. I've quite the objection to how people justify just about anything by just calling it a "fetish".”
「正当化が成立してるかともかく、言いたいことはわかるかも」=“I do get where you're coming from, though I think some are pretty valid.”
「サドとか好例ね。ただ、暴力を振るうのが好きな自分を肯定させたいだけじゃない」=“Sadism is a good example. Isn't that just some people trying to put a positive spin on their violent selves?”
「でも、殴られて興奮する相手がいるからプレイとして成立してる部分もあるし」=“But, I feel like it's valid as a sexual play since there's people out there who like it when they're hit and whatnot.”
「そうかもねと私が肯定したら、何をするつもりなの……？」=“If I say that "you're not wrong about that", what would you do to me...?”
「ただの雑談だから！」=“It's just small talk, just small talk!”
「欲求不満ってヤバいよね？　心が獣になるっていうか」=“Frustration is pretty bad, isn't it? It really turns you into a beast.”
「……真顔でそんなことを言われると同意できるわね」=“...You know, I can't disagree, not when you say such things with a straight face.”
「欲求不満になったことない人ってこの世にいるの？」=“Is there anyone in this world who hasn't felt this feeling, though?”
「そ、それは……いるはずよ。だって、アナタはエッチな意味で言ってのでしょう？」=“T-That's... there should be. I mean, you meant it in a lewd way, right?”
「そうだよ。今もちょっときてるし」=“That's right. Even now, I feel it.”
「な、何を言っているの……？　今のは聞かなかったことにするわ！」=“W-What're you saying...? I'll pretend I didn't hear you there!”
「あのさ……初めてシたときのことなんだけど……どうだった？」=“Listen... about our first time... how was it?”
「それは……ず、随分と急な話ね……どうしてそんなことを聞くの？」=“That's... v-very sudden of you... why do you ask?”
「あの後、全然そんな話題にならなかったから気になって……」=“We didn't talk about it after that at all so, it's on my mind...”
「……もしかして、怒ってるとでも思った？　そんなことはないから安心して」=“...Wait, did you think that I was mad? I wasn't so don't worry about that.”
「ただ……照れ臭かっただけよ。私だって女の子だから」=“It was... just a bit embarrassing, you know. I'm a girl too.”
「そっか……それなら良かった」=“I see... I'm glad to hear that.”
「……気恥ずかしいから、もうこの話は終わりにしていいかしら？」=“...It's very embarrassing so, can we stop that conversation there?”
「う、うん……そうだね」=“Y-Yeah... sure.”
