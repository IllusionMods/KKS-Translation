「体を動かすアクティビティとか好きなの？」=“You like activities where you have to move your body?”
「もちろん大好きだぞ。体を動かしてるだけで楽しくなってくるぞ」=“Of course, I love them. Just moving my body's enough for me to enjoy myself.”
「色んなアクティビティがあって、どれがいいか迷うよね」=“There's so many activities, it's hard to know which ones to do, isn't it?”
「そうだなー。つまんないのはやりたくないから、慎重に選ばないとだぞ」=“Yeah~. I really don't wanna do anything dull so, we gotta pick stuff out carefully.”
「この島、一日中レジャーが出来そうな感じだよね」=“You could enjoy yourself doing some activity or other for the entire day here, couldn't you?”
「まったくだぞー。もう、どこに行ってもレジャーだらけで体がウズウズするぞー」=“Seriously~. No matter where you go, every single place has some thing to do, my body just won't stay still~”
「こんなに遊びがいっぱいだと、ちゃんと研修できそうにないね」=“With so many things to do around here, it's hard to think about actually doing any research, isn't it?”
「遊びも立派な研修の一つだぞー。思いっきり楽しめばいいんだ」=“Doing things and having fun is a big part of research too. Just enjoy yourself and it'll work out.”
「この島、歩いてるだけでもレジャーしてる気分になるね」=“Just walking around the place feels like an activity in itself, doesn't it?”
「この島の空気がそうさせるんだろうなー。もう、レジャーのワンダーランドだぞ」=“I bet it's the air~. Man, this place is just a wonderland of leisure.”
「この島でしかできないアクティビティがあったらやってみたいな」=“If there's an activity that you can only do on this one island, I'd love to try it out.”
「何があるんだろうなー？　海も山もあるからサバイバル体験とか面白そうだぞー」=“I wonder what that could be~? There's the sea and the mountains so I bet a survival experience would be real interesting~”
「本当に、豊かな自然に恵まれた島だよね」=“This island seriously is blessed with a ton of nature, isn't it?”
「そうだなー。こんなに所だと、自然に帰りたくなるぞー」=“Yeah~. It almost makes a girl wanna return to nature~”
「南国なだけあって、珍しい花とか咲いてそうだね」=“With how southern this place is, bet you could find a whole lot of rare flowers here.”
「あたし、花は好きだぞ。花びらの根元を舐めると蜜の味がするからな」=“I seriously love flowers. You can really taste the nectar if you lick the roots of the petals.”
「やっぱり自然が好きなの？」=“I guess you love nature afterall?”
「大好きだぞー。できれば自然の中で暮らしたいと思ってるくらいだからな―」=“I love it tons~. So much so, I almost wanna go back to nature and live within it, just so you know~”
「この辺りは都会と違って空気が汚れてないよね」=“Unlike the city, the air here is not at all dirty, is it?”
「もちろんだぞー。空気が美味しいから、息を吸うだけでおなか一杯になりそうだぞ」=“Of course~. The air's so tasty, just breathing it in is enough to make you feel full.”
「ここは野生の動物とか、いっぱいいそうだよね」=“A place like this would have a lot of wild animals too, wouldn't it?”
「うん。いっぱいいるぞ……動物の気配はニオイでわかるからな」=“Yeah, there's lots of them... I can tell from the smell.”
「こういう自然環境は、大切にしていかないとね」=“We gotta protect natural environments like these, don't we?”
「そうだなー。一度壊れた自然が元に戻るには、すっごく時間がかかるらしいからなー」=“Yeah~. Especially since it takes nature a ton of time to heal, and not much to be destroyed~”
「海が綺麗だと、それだけでテンションが上がるよね」=“Just looking at the clean sea makes you feel excited, doesn't it?”
「まったくだぞー。あんなに水が綺麗だと海の底まで見えるんじゃないかって気がするぞ」=“Seriously~. With how clean it is, it feels like you can almost see to the bottom of it.”
「この辺の海の魚は、あんまり見かけない種類が多いよね」=“There's a lot of fishes around in the water that you don't usually see, aren't there?”
「そうだなー。熱帯魚が多いから、変わった形のもいっぱいだぞ」=“Yeah~. Most of them are tropical ones too, so they've got weird shapes.”
「この島の海で泳いでたら、心も体も綺麗になりそうだね」=“Feels like just going and taking a dip would do a lot for your body and soul, doesn't it?”
「うんうん。ぷかぷか浮かんでるだけで、洗濯されてる気分になりそうだぞ」=“Yepyep. Just floating around in that water would make you feel like your entire being's being laundered.”
「海の生き物って好き？」=“You like the animals in the sea?”
「好きだぞー。見るのも好きだし、美味しいお魚とか大好きだ」=“I do~. I love looking at them, and I love the tastier ones especially.”
「こう暑いと、やっぱり海に行きたくなるよね」=“It's hard to resist the urge to go to the shore when it's this hot, isn't it?”
「この島はずっと夏みたいだからな―。やっぱり海が似合うと思うぞー」=“This island does seem to have summer all around the year, too~. I really do think the sea fits the place~”
「海で遊ぶとしたら何がしたい？」=“What would you do, if you wanted to have some fun in the water?”
「とりあえず泳ぐぞー。それでイルカとかウミガメを探すぞー」=“I'd start with swimming~. And then I'd go and look for a dolphin or a sea turtle or something~”
「この島、特産品が多いから、どれを試そうか迷うよね」=“This island has so many local specialities, it's hard to pick one to buy and see, isn't it?”
「うん。どれがいいものかは、さすがにニオイじゃわからないからなー」=“Yep. Can't exactly tell from their smell either, which ones are good and which ones aren't~”
「自販機の飲み物とか、この島独特な感じだよね」=“The drinks in the vending machines are also really unique and local, aren't they?”
「そうだなー。見たことないものばっかりだから、全部試してみたいぞー」=“Yeah~. Every single one of them's one that I've never seen before, so I wanna try them all~”
「この島、料理の味も独特のものが多いよね」=“The cooking here tends to be really unique too, doesn't it?”
「うんうん。暑い地方だから、調味料の味から違う感じだぞ」=“Yepyep. It's a really hot place so, even just the way they flavour things is different.”
「この島って、よく音楽が流れてるけど、あれもこの島ならではだよね」=“There's always some music playing around the place too, isn't there? That's part of the local culture too, huh?”
「あたしもあの音楽大好きだぞ。陽気で、でものんびりしてて、ついつい聞き入っちゃうぞー」=“I love that music too. It's so jovial, let laid back, I just can't help but stand and listen sometimes~”
「この島、探せば野生のフルーツとかいっぱいありそうだよね」=“I bet you could find a whole lot of fruits growing out in the wild here.”
「おー、だったらあたしはマンゴーが食べたいな。マンゴー探しに行こう」=“Oh~, I wanna eat a mango then. Let's go look for some mangoes.”
「サトウキビに、フルーツに、お菓子……考えてみると、特産品は甘いモノが多いのかな」=“Sugarcane, fruits, sweets... thinking about it, a whole lot of the local specialities are just sweet things.”
「暑い所では甘いモノを食べてカロリーを補給するって聞いたことがあるぞ。何となくわかる気がするなー」=“I've heard that that's how it goes in hot places, since you gotta replenish calories often. I can see it too~”
「変わった体位のエッチってしてみたい？」=“You wanna try out some weird positions in bed?”
「何言ってんだ、キミは……まぁ、気持ちいいなら興味あるかもなー」=“What are you even saying... well, if you think it'll feel good then I might.”
「おちんちん、生やしてみたい？」=“You wanna try growing a dick?”
「おちんちん？　あったら面白いと思うけど、キミのがあれば十分だぞ」=“A dick? It'd be pretty interesting I guess but, yours is enough for me.”
「エッチの時って、何考えてるの？」=“What goes through your head, when we have sex?”
「何にも考えてないぞー。あえて言うなら……子孫繁栄、かな？」=“Nothing at all~. If I really had to say... making babies, I guess?”
「この話はおわりー。もうおしまいだからなー」=“No more of that~. No more, I tell you.”
「キミはどうしようもないなー。答えるわけないぞー」=“There really is no fixing you, is there? No way I'm answering that.”
