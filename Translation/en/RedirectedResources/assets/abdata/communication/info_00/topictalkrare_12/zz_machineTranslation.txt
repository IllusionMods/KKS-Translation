「ホエールウォッチングって、どう？」=“How do you like whale watching?”
「なにが聞きたいのやら……クジラは好きだよ。デカくて、強いし」=“I don't know what you want to hear. ...... I like whales. They're big and strong.”
「デカいけど、強いのかな？」=“They're big, but are they strong?”
「デカいと強いんだよ。強ければ気持ちに余裕が出るし、周りに優しくなれるんだ」=“Bigger is stronger, you know. When you're big, you're strong. When you're strong, you feel more relaxed and you're kinder to others.”
「……まあ、それはそうかもね」=“...... Well, maybe that's true.”
「おまえもクジラみたいな男になれよ」=“You should be a whale of a man.”
「……うーん、考えておくよ」=“...... Hmm, I'll think about it.”
「ヤシガニって怖いよね」=“Palm crabs are scary, right?”
「あー……あれは少しな……大きすぎてちょっとグロテスクというか……」=“Oh, ...... they're a little ...... too big and a little grotesque.”
「……美味しいらしいけど、食べたエサによっては毒があるみたいだね」=“...... I hear they're tasty, but some of the food they eat can be poisonous.”
「いやいや、あんなの食いたくないっての！」=“No, no, no, I don't want to eat that!”
「……でも、普通のカニや海老と見た目的にそう変わらなくない？」=“I don't want to eat that! - ...... But it doesn't look that different from regular crabs and shrimps, does it?”
「カニはともかく海老には似てないだろう。そもそもあいつはヤドカリだ」=“No, I don't want to eat that! It's a hermit crab, after all.”
「月桃の花って、なんだか独特だよね」=“Moon peach blossoms are kind of unique, aren't they?”
「ああ、確かに。でもいい香りがするから嫌いじゃないよ」=“Yeah, sure. Yeah, it's true, but I don't mind it because it smells so good.”
「アロマとしても有名だし、あと葉っぱは食べ物を包んで蒸したりするらしいな」=“It's famous for its aroma and the leaves are used to wrap and steam food.”
「詳しいね。けっこう気に入ってるんだ？」=“You know a lot about it. You know a lot about it. You like it a lot?”
「ちょっと調べただけだって。まぁ、気に入ってるのは確かだけど」=“I just did some research. Well, I'm sure I like it.”
「野生のヤマネコ……また見てみたいなぁ」=“I'd like to see the bobcat ...... in the wild again.”
「まあ、一見可愛いけど、絶対に懐かないからな」=“Well, they're cute at first glance, but they never take to you.”
「そもそも触れたり飼ったりは禁止されてるから、見るだけにしとかなきゃ」=“You're not allowed to touch them or keep them in the first place, so you have to just look at them.”
「……残念だな。でも近所の野良猫が結構懐いてくれてるから寂しくないかな」=“...... That's too bad. It's a shame, but the stray cats in my neighborhood are pretty friendly, so I won't miss them.”
「ま、マジか……あたしでも触らせてくれるかな？」=“Seriously, ......, do you think they'll let me touch them?”
「あはは、多分ね。人懐っこい子だからさ」=“Haha, maybe. She's very friendly.”
「そうか！　じゃ、近々触りにいこうかな。お前んちに行くついでに」=“Oh, yeah!　Then I'll go touch her soon. While I'm at your place.”
「うん、いつでも遊びにおいでよ」=“Yeah, you're welcome to come by anytime.”
「この辺りは、流れ星のスポットとして有名みたいだよ」=“I hear this area is famous for shooting stars.”
「海に囲まれてるからかな？　でも、山の方が空に近いからよく見えそうだ」=“Maybe it's because we're surrounded by the sea?　Maybe it's because we're surrounded by the ocean, but I think you'll see more shooting stars in the mountains because they're closer to the sky.”
「山のリゾートにも、行ってみたいなぁ」=“I'd like to go to a mountain resort.”
「山のリゾートかぁ……それなら温泉だな」=“Mountain resorts. ...... I'd like to go to a hot spring.”
「スキーとか、スノボもできるといいね」=“I'd like to go skiing and snowboarding.”
「なんだか冬が恋しくなってきた……海は海で最高に楽しいけど」=“I'm starting to miss winter. ...... The sea is great fun, but...”
「サガリバナって、一夜咲いたら散っちゃうんだよね……儚いなぁ」=“Sagaribana blooms for a night and then fades away. ...... It's so fragile.”
「もうちょっと頑張ればいいのにな。でも、そういう花だから仕方ないか」=“You should try a little harder. I wish they'd try a little harder, but that's just the way they are.”
「だからこそ、尊いんだよ」=“That's why they're so precious.”
「咲き続ける花も、立派で偉いと思うぞ」=“I think it's great that they keep blooming.”
「しかし、なんでそんな短命なんだろうな」=“But I wonder why they're so short-lived.”
「うぅん……いったいなぜなんだろうね」=“Hmm. ...... I wonder why that is.”
「なんか、気の毒だな……一度、生で見て、軽く手を合わせて拝んでやりたいな」=“I feel sorry for them. ...... I'd like to see them in the flesh and worship them with my hands.”
「そ、そういう扱いは、逆に気の毒な気がするけど……」=“Yeah, it's kind of a pity to treat it that way. ......”
「気にかけていた鳥の巣があってさ、そこで雛がかえったんだ」=“There's a bird's nest that I've been keeping an eye on, and a chick just hatched there.”
「へえ、なんて名前の鳥なんだ？　スズメ？　ハト？　モズ？」=“Oh, what kind of bird is that?　Sparrow?　Pigeon?　Shrike?”
「え、ええっと、なんだったかな……？」=“What's it called, ......?”
「ちゃんと調べておけよー。珍しい鳥かもしれないんだからさ」=“You should do some research. It could be a rare bird.”
「ともかく、余計な手出しはするんじゃないぞ？　これからも見るだけだ」=“Anyway, don't do anything you don't want to do.　Just keep looking.”
「うん、触ったりはしないよ。親鳥が育てなくなるかもしれないからね」=“No, I'm not going to touch it. Well, I won't touch it, because I don't want the parent bird to grow up.”
「そういえばさ、水やりしてたアサガオに花が咲いたんだ」=“Oh, by the way, the morning glory I've been watering has bloomed.”
「へぇ、やるじゃん。目が出て蔓が伸びていく感じ……結構好きなんだ」=“Oh, that's great. I like the way the eyes appear and the vine grows .......”
「ああ、かなり高いところまで伸びるって話だね」=“Yeah, I've heard it can grow pretty high.”
「庭に埋めて、二階の窓で咲くこともあるんだってさ」=“They bury them in the garden and sometimes they bloom in the upstairs window.”
「そういうの、なんかいいね」=“That's very nice.”
「あたしも、帰ったら鉢植えに植えてみるかな……」=“Maybe I'll plant one when I get home. ......”
「マンタって、なんだか怖いね……デカすぎだよ、あれ」=“Manta rays are kind of scary. ...... They're too big, man.”
「そうか？　もっとデカくてもいいんじゃないか？」=“Really?　Couldn't they be bigger?”
「え？　あれよりも？」=“What?　Bigger than that?”
「乗って泳いだりできそうじゃん」=“It looks like it could swim on top of you.”
「あのサイズでも十分上に乗れそうだよ」=“I think I could get on top of that thing.”
「うーん、振り落とされたら怖いし……やっぱりあの倍はほしいな」=“Hmm, I'm afraid of being knocked off. ...... I want it to be twice that size.”
「……そうなると人が襲われそうだけどね」=“...... Then people might get attacked.”
「海ほたるって綺麗だね」=“Sea fireflies are beautiful, aren't they?”
「ああ、光ってるところは綺麗だな」=“Yeah, it's beautiful when it glows.”
「でも、その正体は……」=“But what it is, it's ......”
「言わなくていいよ。そもそも知ってるし」=“You don't have to tell me. I know what it is.”
「……引いたりしないの？」=“Don't you ever go to ......?”
「まぁ、わざわざ近づこうとしないし……遠目で見て綺麗ならそれでいいんだよ」=“Well, I don't try to get close to them. ...... If they're beautiful from a distance, that's fine.”
「この地方は、ウミガメが結構いるみたいだね」=“I hear there are a lot of sea turtles in this area.”
「へぇ、そうなんだ。運がよかったら会えるかな？」=“Oh, I see. I wonder if I'll be lucky enough to meet one?”
「せっかくなら産卵してるところを生で見たいな～」=“If I have to, I'd like to see them laying eggs in person.”
「姿を見かけても、産卵してるところは難しいんじゃない？　人がいたらこないだろうし」=“Even if I see them, it would be difficult to see them spawning, wouldn't it?　Even if I saw them, it would be difficult to see them spawning, because they wouldn't be there if anyone was around.”
「それもそうだな……で、でも、諦めなければ可能性はゼロじゃないだろ？」=“That's true, ......, but if you don't give up, there's no chance, right?”
「まぁ……そうだけど」=“Well, ...... that's true.”
「よしっ……根気よく待ってみるかな」=“Okay. ...... I'll wait patiently.”
「星の砂って、どうしてあんな形になるのか知ってる？」=“Do you know why star sand is shaped like that?”
「いや、知らないな。教えてくれ」=“No, I don't. Tell me.”
「もともとああいう形の何かなんだってさ」=“They say it's originally something like that.”
「……いや『何か』じゃわからないだろ？　なんなんだよ」=“...... No, "something" doesn't tell you anything, does it?　What is it?”
「なんなんだろうね……いやぁ、自然って雄大だなぁ……」=“I wonder what it is. ...... Well, nature is magnificent. ......”
「どんなごまかし方なんだ……」=“What kind of deception is this? ......”
「ウムイの鐘があるところって、すごく綺麗な場所だよね」=“The place with the bells of Umui is a very beautiful place.”
「ああ、ジンクスどうこうじゃなく、普通に観光地としていい場所だと思う」=“Yeah, I don't think it's a jinx, I think it's a great place to visit.”
「でも、あの鐘がなかったらわざわざ行く人って少なそうだよね」=“But if it wasn't for the bell, I don't think many people would go there.”
「そうか？　近くに灯台があるし、みんな行くと思うけど」=“Do you think so?　There's a lighthouse nearby, so I think people would go there.”
「それにあそこは風が気持ちいいし、涼むのには最適な場所じゃないか？」=“Besides, it's a nice breeze and a perfect place to cool off, isn't it?”
「確かに。暑い島だし、涼める場所として人気はありそう」=“Sure. It's a hot island and it's a popular place to cool off.”
「おっぱいは感度だと思うんだ」=“I think tits are sensitive.”
「……いきなり何を言ってるんだ？　わけがわからないぞ」=“...... What the hell are you talking about?　I don't get it.”
「頭ごなしに否定はしないけどさ、ちゃんと筋道を話してくれよ」=“I'm not denying it out of the blue, but you have to talk some sense into me.”
「ああ、ごめん……突然言いたくなったんだ」=“Oh, I'm sorry. ...... I just had to say it.”
「……まあ、男からしたらそうなのかもな。って、本当に思ったことを口にしただけなのかよ」=“I'm sorry, ...... I just felt like saying it out of the blue. ...... Well, maybe from a guy's point of view. You're just saying what you really think?”
「うん」=“Yeah.”
「突然だけど、何かフェチってある？」=“I know it's sudden, but do you have any fetishes?”
「本当に突然だな……んー……どうだろう？　あんまりないかも……」=“It's really sudden. ...... Hmmm ...... I wonder?　Not really. ......”
「あんまりない……ってことは、少しはあるってこと？」=“Not much. ...... Does that mean you have a few?”
「そりゃまあ多少は……でも、わざわざ語って聞かせるほどじゃないな」=“Well, there's some ......, but not enough to make me talk about it.”
「いや、聞かせてほしいんだ！　一生のお願い！」=“No, I want to hear it!　I'm asking you for a lifetime!”
「こんなことで一生のお願いを消費する男には言いたくないって……」=“I don't want to tell a man that he's going to consume the request of a lifetime. ......”
「ねえ、欲求不満な時って、どうしてるの？」=“Hey, what do you do when you're frustrated?”
「はぁ……子供じゃないんだから、それぐらい想像がつくだろ？」=“Huh. ...... You're not a child, you can imagine that, can't you?”
「じゃあ、想像通りのことしてるってこと？」=“So you're saying you do what you imagine?”
「そう言ってるじゃん」=“That's what you're saying.”
「なるほどなるほど……ふーん」=“I see. I see. ...... Hmm.”
「……まあ、お前の気が済むなら、好きにすりゃいいよ」=“...... Well, if it makes you feel better, you can do whatever you want.”
「初めてエッチした時のことだけどさ」=“You know, the first time we had sex.”
「……そんな話、今するのか？　まぁ、別にいいけど」=“The first time we had sex. ...... Are we talking about that now?　Well, that's okay.”
「もっと、こう……優しく出来たんじゃないかなって思うんだ」=“I feel like I could've been more ...... gentle.”
「……そ、そうなんだ。でも、あたしは……あれで良かったって思ってるよ」=“...... Yeah, that's right. But I'm glad it was ...... that way.”
「だから、なんだ？　そんなに気にしなくてもいいんじゃないか？」=“So what?　You don't have to worry about it so much, do you?”
「ありがとう。でも、男としては精進しないといけないことだから頑張るよ」=“Thank you. But as a man, I have to be diligent, so I'll do my best.”
「……そんな決意を聞かされても、こっちは困るだけだって」=“...... I don't want to hear about your determination.”
