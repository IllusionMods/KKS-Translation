「ホエールウォッチングって、どう？」=“How do you like whale watching?”
「なにが聞きたいのやら……クジラは好きだよ。デカくて、強いし」=“I don't know what you're asking... I like whales. They're big and strong.”
「デカいけど、強いのかな？」=“They're big, but are they strong?”
「デカいと強いんだよ。強ければ気持ちに余裕が出るし、周りに優しくなれるんだ」=“Bigger is stronger. When you're strong, you're more comfortable and kinder to others around you.”
「……まあ、それはそうかもね」=“...well, maybe that's true.”
「おまえもクジラみたいな男になれよ」=“You could be a man like a whale, too.”
「……うーん、考えておくよ」=“...hmm, I'll think about it.”
「ヤシガニって怖いよね」=“Palm crabs are scary.”
「あー……あれは少しな……大きすぎてちょっとグロテスクというか……」=“Ah-... they are, a little... they're too big, and kind of grotesque.”
「……美味しいらしいけど、食べたエサによっては毒があるみたいだね」=“.. I hear they're tasty, but some of the food they eat can be poisonous.”
「いやいや、あんなの食いたくないっての！」=“No, no, I don't want to eat them!”
「……でも、普通のカニや海老と見た目的にそう変わらなくない？」=“But they don't look that different from regular crabs and shrimp, do they?”
「カニはともかく海老には似てないだろう。そもそもあいつはヤドカリだ」=“Crabs don't look like shrimp, anyway. And, in the first place, they're hermit crabs.”
「月桃の花って、なんだか独特だよね」=“Shell ginger blossoms are kind of unique.”
「ああ、確かに。でもいい香りがするから嫌いじゃないよ」=“Ahhh, sure. Yeah, it's true, but I don't mind it because they smell so good.”
「アロマとしても有名だし、あと葉っぱは食べ物を包んで蒸したりするらしいな」=“It's famous for its aroma, and the leaves are used to wrap and steam food.”
「詳しいね。けっこう気に入ってるんだ？」=“You knew that. You really like it?”
「ちょっと調べただけだって。まぁ、気に入ってるのは確かだけど」=“I did a little research. Well, I'm sure I like it.”
「野生のヤマネコ……また見てみたいなぁ」=“I'd love to see another wildcat.”
「まあ、一見可愛いけど、絶対に懐かないからな」=“Well, they're cute at first glance, but they'll never take to you.”
「そもそも触れたり飼ったりは禁止されてるから、見るだけにしとかなきゃ」=“You're not allowed to touch them or keep them in the first place, so you have to just look at them.”
「……残念だな。でも近所の野良猫が結構懐いてくれてるから寂しくないかな」=“...that's a shame. But the stray cats in my neighborhood are pretty friendly to me, so I guess it might just take to me.”
「ま、マジか……あたしでも触らせてくれるかな？」=“Seriously... do you think they'll let me touch them?”
「あはは、多分ね。人懐っこい子だからさ」=“Haha, maybe. You're a friendly girl.”
「そうか！　じゃ、近々触りにいこうかな。お前んちに行くついでに」=“Oh, yeah!　Then I'll go and pet them. While I'm on the way to your place.”
「うん、いつでも遊びにおいでよ」=“Yeah, you're welcome to come by anytime.”
「この辺りは、流れ星のスポットとして有名みたいだよ」=“It seems this spot is famous for its shooting stars.”
「海に囲まれてるからかな？　でも、山の方が空に近いからよく見えそうだ」=“Maybe it's because it's surround by the ocean?　But, the mountains are closer to the sky, so you could see them better there.”
「山のリゾートにも、行ってみたいなぁ」=“I'd love to visit a mountain resort.”
「山のリゾートかぁ……それなら温泉だな」=“A mountain resort... and then the hot springs.”
「スキーとか、スノボもできるといいね」=“I'd like to go skiing and snowboarding.”
「なんだか冬が恋しくなってきた……海は海で最高に楽しいけど」=“I kinda miss winter... I mean, the ocean's great fun, but...”
「サガリバナって、一夜咲いたら散っちゃうんだよね……儚いなぁ」=“Sagaribana blooms for a night and then fades away... so ephermeral.”
「もうちょっと頑張ればいいのにな。でも、そういう花だから仕方ないか」=“ I wish they'd try a little harder. But that's just the kind of flower it is.”
「だからこそ、尊いんだよ」=“That's why they're so precious.”
「咲き続ける花も、立派で偉いと思うぞ」=“Well, I think flowers that keep blooming are pretty great.”
「しかし、なんでそんな短命なんだろうな」=“But I wonder why they're so short-lived.”
「うぅん……いったいなぜなんだろうね」=“Yeeeah... I wonder why that is.”
「なんか、気の毒だな……一度、生で見て、軽く手を合わせて拝んでやりたいな」=“I feel sorry for them... I'd like to see one in person, lightly clasp my hands together, and worship it.”
「そ、そういう扱いは、逆に気の毒な気がするけど……」=“Th-that's now how to treat it. I actually kinda feel sorry for you now...”
「気にかけていた鳥の巣があってさ、そこで雛がかえったんだ」=“There's this bird's nest I've been keeping an eye on, and a chick just hatched there.”
「へえ、なんて名前の鳥なんだ？　スズメ？　ハト？　モズ？」=“Ehe, what kind of bird ?　Sparrow?　Pigeon?　Shrike?”
「え、ええっと、なんだったかな……？」=“Eh, eer, um... I wonder...?”
「ちゃんと調べておけよー。珍しい鳥かもしれないんだからさ」=“Do your research-. It could be a rare bird.”
「ともかく、余計な手出しはするんじゃないぞ？　これからも見るだけだ」=“Anyway, don't try anything unnecessary, okay? Just keep watching it.”
「うん、触ったりはしないよ。親鳥が育てなくなるかもしれないからね」=“Yeah, I'm not going to touch it. Otherwise, the parent the birds might stop raising them.”
「そういえばさ、水やりしてたアサガオに花が咲いたんだ」=“Oh, by the way, the morning glory I've been watering has bloomed.”
「へぇ、やるじゃん。目が出て蔓が伸びていく感じ……結構好きなんだ」=“Ehe, that's great. I seems the blooms are coming out and the vines are growing... I like that lot.”
「ああ、かなり高いところまで伸びるって話だね」=“Ahh, you're talking about how they stretch really high.”
「庭に埋めて、二階の窓で咲くこともあるんだってさ」=“If you bury one in the garden, it's said they'll end up blooming in the upstairs windows.”
「そういうの、なんかいいね」=“That sort of thing is kinda nice.”
「あたしも、帰ったら鉢植えに植えてみるかな……」=“I think I'll try planting some in a pot when I get home...”
「マンタって、なんだか怖いね……デカすぎだよ、あれ」=“Manta rays are kind of scary... and they're just so big.”
「そうか？　もっとデカくてもいいんじゃないか？」=“That so?　They could be bigger, you know?”
「え？　あれよりも？」=“Eh?　Even bigger?”
「乗って泳いだりできそうじゃん」=“I bet you could swim on top of it.”
「あのサイズでも十分上に乗れそうだよ」=“Even at their usual size, it's plenty big enough to ride on top.”
「うーん、振り落とされたら怖いし……やっぱりあの倍はほしいな」=“Mmmmm, I'd be afraid of being knocked off... I'd want it to be twice as big.”
「……そうなると人が襲われそうだけどね」=“...if that were the case, though, they'd attack people.”
「海ほたるって綺麗だね」=“Sea fireflies are beautiful.”
「ああ、光ってるところは綺麗だな」=“Ahh, they're beautiful when they glow.”
「でも、その正体は……」=“But what they really are is...”
「言わなくていいよ。そもそも知ってるし」=“You don't have to tell me. I already know.”
「……引いたりしないの？」=“...don't you ever go down to examine them?”
「まぁ、わざわざ近づこうとしないし……遠目で見て綺麗ならそれでいいんだよ」=“Well, I don't bother getting closer... if they're beautiful from a distance, that's fine.”
「この地方は、ウミガメが結構いるみたいだね」=“It seems there's quite a lot of sea turtles around here.”
「へぇ、そうなんだ。運がよかったら会えるかな？」=“Ehe, is that so. I wonder if I'll be lucky enough to meet one?”
「せっかくなら産卵してるところを生で見たいな～」=“I'd like to see them laying eggs in person~”
「姿を見かけても、産卵してるところは難しいんじゃない？　人がいたらこないだろうし」=“But if you saw one, it's hard to find out where they're laying eggs, isn't it? They don't go where people are.”
「それもそうだな……で、でも、諦めなければ可能性はゼロじゃないだろ？」=“That's true... but if you just give up, there's no chance at all, right?”
「まぁ……そうだけど」=“Well... I guess so.”
「よしっ……根気よく待ってみるかな」=“Right... guess I'll have to patiently wait.”
「星の砂って、どうしてあんな形になるのか知ってる？」=“Do you know why star sand is shaped like that?”
「いや、知らないな。教えてくれ」=“No, I don't. Tell me.”
「もともとああいう形の何かなんだってさ」=“I'd said it's originally something like that.”
「……いや『何か』じゃわからないだろ？　なんなんだよ」=“...no, 'something' doesn't help me understand. What the hell.”
「なんなんだろうね……いやぁ、自然って雄大だなぁ……」=“I wonder what it is... no, ah, nature is magnificent...”
「どんなごまかし方なんだ……」=“What kind of deception is this...”
「ウムイの鐘があるところって、すごく綺麗な場所だよね」=“That spot where the Umui Bell's at is very pretty.”
「ああ、ジンクスどうこうじゃなく、普通に観光地としていい場所だと思う」=“Ahhh, it's not about the jinx, it's a nice spot to visit on its own.”
「でも、あの鐘がなかったらわざわざ行く人って少なそうだよね」=“But if it weren't for the Bell, I don't think many people would go out of their way to get there.”
「そうか？　近くに灯台があるし、みんな行くと思うけど」=“That so?　There's a lighthouse nearby, so I think people would go there.”
「それにあそこは風が気持ちいいし、涼むのには最適な場所じゃないか？」=“Besides, it's breezy up there, so it's a great place to cool off, isn't it?”
「確かに。暑い島だし、涼める場所として人気はありそう」=“Certainly. It's hot here, so I could see it as a popular place to cool off.”
「おっぱいは感度だと思うんだ」=“So I'm thinking that boobs are sensitive.”
「……いきなり何を言ってるんだ？　わけがわからないぞ」=“...what is this, all the sudden?　I don't get it.”
「頭ごなしに否定はしないけどさ、ちゃんと筋道を話してくれよ」=“I mean, I'm not just going to deny it out of hand, but you need to tell me what's going on.”
「ああ、ごめん……突然言いたくなったんだ」=“Ahh, sorry... it's just something I suddenly wanted to say.”
「……まあ、男からしたらそうなのかもな。って、本当に思ったことを口にしただけなのかよ」=“Well, maybe from a man's perspective. I mean, did you really just blurt out what you were thinking?”
「うん」=“Yeah.”
「突然だけど、何かフェチってある？」=“This might be sudden, but do you have any fetishes?”
「本当に突然だな……んー……どうだろう？　あんまりないかも……」=“That is really sudden... nh-... I wonder? Maybe not so much...”
「あんまりない……ってことは、少しはあるってこと？」=“Not so much... so maybe just a little, then?”
「そりゃまあ多少は……でも、わざわざ語って聞かせるほどじゃないな」=“Well, maybe a little... but I'm not going to go through the bother of telling you about it.”
「いや、聞かせてほしいんだ！　一生のお願い！」=“No, I want to hear it!　I'm begging you! I'll never ask for anything else, as long as I live!”
「こんなことで一生のお願いを消費する男には言いたくないって……」=“I don't want to tell a man that this will use up his lifetime quota of requests.”
「ねえ、欲求不満な時って、どうしてるの？」=“Hey, what do you do when you're frustrated?”
「はぁ……子供じゃないんだから、それぐらい想像がつくだろ？」=“*Sigh*... You're not a child. You can surely imagine that, can't you?”
「じゃあ、想像通りのことしてるってこと？」=“Then you do exactly what I imagine you're doing?”
「そう言ってるじゃん」=“That's what I'm saying.”
「なるほどなるほど……ふーん」=“I see, I see... hmmm.”
「……まあ、お前の気が済むなら、好きにすりゃいいよ」=“...well, you can imagine whatever you want, if it makes you feel better.”
「初めてエッチした時のことだけどさ」=“So, you know, the first time we had sex...”
「……そんな話、今するのか？　まぁ、別にいいけど」=“...we're talking about that now? Well, it's not like I have a problem.”
「もっと、こう……優しく出来たんじゃないかなって思うんだ」=“I feel like I could have been... more gentle.”
「……そ、そうなんだ。でも、あたしは……あれで良かったって思ってるよ」=“...th-that's right. But, I'm... glad that we did it.”
「だから、なんだ？　そんなに気にしなくてもいいんじゃないか？」=“So, what the hell?　You don't gotta worry so much about it, okay?”
「ありがとう。でも、男としては精進しないといけないことだから頑張るよ」=“Thank you. But as a man, it's something I need to be diligent about, so I'll keep doing my best.”
「……そんな決意を聞かされても、こっちは困るだけだって」=“...I'm not sure I want to hear you make that kind of commitment.”
