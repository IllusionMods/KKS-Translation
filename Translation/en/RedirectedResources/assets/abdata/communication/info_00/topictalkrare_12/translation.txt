「ホエールウォッチングって、どう？」=“So, whale watching?”
「なにが聞きたいのやら……クジラは好きだよ。デカくて、強いし」=“Just what are you even asking... I do like whales. They're big, and strong.”
「デカいけど、強いのかな？」=“They are pretty big, but are they really strong?”
「デカいと強いんだよ。強ければ気持ちに余裕が出るし、周りに優しくなれるんだ」=“Big is strong. And if you're strong, you've got the room in your heart to be nice to those around you.”
「……まあ、それはそうかもね」=“...Well, I guess.”
「おまえもクジラみたいな男になれよ」=“Be a whale of a man yourself too.”
「……うーん、考えておくよ」=“...Nnn, I'll take it under advisement.”
「ヤシガニって怖いよね」=“Coconut crabs are pretty darn scary, aren't they?”
「あー……あれは少しな……大きすぎてちょっとグロテスクというか……」=“Ah... kinda, yeah... they're so big and, kinda grotesque...”
「……美味しいらしいけど、食べたエサによっては毒があるみたいだね」=“...Apparently, their meat's pretty tasty, but depending on what they're fed, it can be poisonous.”
「いやいや、あんなの食いたくないっての！」=“No way in hell am I eating one of those!”
「……でも、普通のカニや海老と見た目的にそう変わらなくない？」=“...But, are they really all that different from a regular old crab or lobster?”
「カニはともかく海老には似てないだろう。そもそもあいつはヤドカリだ」=“Crabs are one thing but lobsters? To begin with, they're hermit crabs.”
「月桃の花って、なんだか独特だよね」=“Shell gingers are pretty 'unique' flowers, aren't they?”
「ああ、確かに。でもいい香りがするから嫌いじゃないよ」=“Yeah, for sure. But they smell nice so I don't hate them.”
「アロマとしても有名だし、あと葉っぱは食べ物を包んで蒸したりするらしいな」=“They're famous for their aroma and, apparently their leaves are used to wrap up some foods for steaming.”
「詳しいね。けっこう気に入ってるんだ？」=“You know your stuff. You into them?”
「ちょっと調べただけだって。まぁ、気に入ってるのは確かだけど」=“I just looked them up a bit. But well, I guess I am pretty into them, yeah.”
「野生のヤマネコ……また見てみたいなぁ」=“Man... I wanna see another wildcat.”
「まあ、一見可愛いけど、絶対に懐かないからな」=“Well, it might look cute but don't kid yourself, it's not gonna take to you.”
「そもそも触れたり飼ったりは禁止されてるから、見るだけにしとかなきゃ」=“To begin with, keeping them and even just touching them is banned so, looking is all you can do anyway.”
「……残念だな。でも近所の野良猫が結構懐いてくれてるから寂しくないかな」=“...What a shame. But well, the neighbourhood cats back home like me a lot so I guess I don't feel too bad about it.”
「ま、マジか……あたしでも触らせてくれるかな？」=“F-For real?... You think they'll let me touch them too?”
「あはは、多分ね。人懐っこい子だからさ」=“Ahahah, probably. They're very friendly.”
「そうか！　じゃ、近々触りにいこうかな。お前んちに行くついでに」=“I see! I guess I'll go have a look at them myself. When I'm over at your place, I mean.”
「うん、いつでも遊びにおいでよ」=“Yeah, come over whenever.”
「この辺りは、流れ星のスポットとして有名みたいだよ」=“Seems like this area is pretty well known for its starry skies.”
「海に囲まれてるからかな？　でも、山の方が空に近いからよく見えそうだ」=“Wonder if that's because the place is surrounded by the sea? But, mountains are much closer to the sky so I feel like you'd get a better look there.”
「山のリゾートにも、行ってみたいなぁ」=“Man, I wanna try vacationing at a mountain resort too~”
「山のリゾートかぁ……それなら温泉だな」=“A mountain resort, huh... that'd also mean a hot spring.”
「スキーとか、スノボもできるといいね」=“And if we could go skiing and snowboarding too, that'd be just perfect.”
「なんだか冬が恋しくなってきた……海は海で最高に楽しいけど」=“Now I kinda want it to be winter again... The sea's perfectly enjoyable by itself though.”
「サガリバナって、一夜咲いたら散っちゃうんだよね……儚いなぁ」=“Mango pines wither after only blooming for one night, don't they?... So fleeting.”
「もうちょっと頑張ればいいのにな。でも、そういう花だから仕方ないか」=“It'd be nice if they could try a bit harder. But I guess they can't help their what they are.”
「だからこそ、尊いんだよ」=“They're precious because they're like that.”
「咲き続ける花も、立派で偉いと思うぞ」=“I think flowers that stay alive for longer than that are still pretty beautiful and respectable though.”
「しかし、なんでそんな短命なんだろうな」=“Still, I do wonder why they're so short lived.”
「うぅん……いったいなぜなんだろうね」=“Nnnnn... It really does make you wonder.”
「なんか、気の毒だな……一度、生で見て、軽く手を合わせて拝んでやりたいな」=“They're kinda pitiful, aren't they... I wanna see them once for myself, pay my respects by stroking them a bit, you know?”
「そ、そういう扱いは、逆に気の毒な気がするけど……」=“I-I feel like that'd somehow make it even more pitiful...”
「気にかけていた鳥の巣があってさ、そこで雛がかえったんだ」=“There's this birds' nest I've been watching, and a chick hatched in it.”
「へえ、なんて名前の鳥なんだ？　スズメ？　ハト？　モズ？」=“Hoh, what bird is it? A sparrow? A pigeon? Or a shrike?”
「え、ええっと、なんだったかな……？」=“E-Eerhm, what was it...”
「ちゃんと調べておけよー。珍しい鳥かもしれないんだからさ」=“You gotta look into that stuff properly. You never know, it could be a rare species.”
「ともかく、余計な手出しはするんじゃないぞ？　これからも見るだけだ」=“Anyways, you better not go pawing at it and stuff, alright? Only watching and no further.”
「うん、触ったりはしないよ。親鳥が育てなくなるかもしれないからね」=“Yep, I won't touch it or anything. The mother might stop raising it after all.”
「そういえばさ、水やりしてたアサガオに花が咲いたんだ」=“Reminds me, this morning glory I've been watering finally bloomed some flowers.”
「へぇ、やるじゃん。目が出て蔓が伸びていく感じ……結構好きなんだ」=“Hoh, good job. The way their vines slowly climb up is... kinda nice.”
「ああ、かなり高いところまで伸びるって話だね」=“Yeah, they can creep up pretty darn high, can't they?”
「庭に埋めて、二階の窓で咲くこともあるんだってさ」=“Apparently if you shift them to the ground, they can sometimes grow as high as the second floor window of the lodge house.”
「そういうの、なんかいいね」=“That's kinda nice.”
「あたしも、帰ったら鉢植えに植えてみるかな……」=“Maybe I'll grow one in a pot too, back home...”
「マンタって、なんだか怖いね……デカすぎだよ、あれ」=“Mantas are pretty scary, aren't they... they're way too big, for one.”
「そうか？　もっとデカくてもいいんじゃないか？」=“Really? They could stand to be a bit bigger, I think.”
「え？　あれよりも？」=“Eh? Bigger than that?”
「乗って泳いだりできそうじゃん」=“Think, we'd be able to ride them.”
「あのサイズでも十分上に乗れそうだよ」=“I think they're plenty rideable even at their current size.”
「うーん、振り落とされたら怖いし……やっぱりあの倍はほしいな」=“Nnnn, but you wouldn't wanna get thrown off, you know?... Yeah, they gotta be twice as big.”
「……そうなると人が襲われそうだけどね」=“...That big and they might just start attacking people.”
「海ほたるって綺麗だね」=“Sea fireflies are so pretty, aren't they?”
「ああ、光ってるところは綺麗だな」=“Yeah, they look very pretty when they glow.”
「でも、その正体は……」=“But in actuality, they look like...”
「言わなくていいよ。そもそも知ってるし」=“You don't need to go out of your way. To begin with, I know already.”
「……引いたりしないの？」=“...It doesn't disgust you?”
「まぁ、わざわざ近づこうとしないし……遠目で見て綺麗ならそれでいいんだよ」=“Well, it's not like I'm gonna go up close to one myself... they're pretty from afar, so I don't care.”
「この地方は、ウミガメが結構いるみたいだね」=“Seems like there's a whole lot of sea turtles here, huh?”
「へぇ、そうなんだ。運がよかったら会えるかな？」=“Hoh, I see. You think we'll get to see any, if we're lucky?”
「せっかくなら産卵してるところを生で見たいな～」=“Man, since we're here, I wanna see one giving birth, you know~”
「姿を見かけても、産卵してるところは難しいんじゃない？　人がいたらこないだろうし」=“Seeing one is one thing but, wouldn't that be pretty hard? It probably won't lay eggs if it sees people around.”
「それもそうだな……で、でも、諦めなければ可能性はゼロじゃないだろ？」=“I guess you're right... b-but, the possibility isn't zero, no? As long as we don't give up...”
「まぁ……そうだけど」=“Well... I guess.”
「よしっ……根気よく待ってみるかな」=“Alright--... I shall patiently wait for the chance.”
「星の砂って、どうしてあんな形になるのか知ってる？」=“You know why starsand's the shape that it is?”
「いや、知らないな。教えてくれ」=“Nah, I don't. Tell me.”
「もともとああいう形の何かなんだってさ」=“Apparently it used to be something in that shape to begin with.”
「……いや『何か』じゃわからないだろ？　なんなんだよ」=“...Something what? How am I supposed to figure it out from that?”
「なんなんだろうね……いやぁ、自然って雄大だなぁ……」=“Well, let's just say... nature sure is sublime...”
「どんなごまかし方なんだ……」=“What are you even trying to hide...”
「ウムイの鐘があるところって、すごく綺麗な場所だよね」=“The place where the bell of Umuy is, is really pretty, isn't it?”
「ああ、ジンクスどうこうじゃなく、普通に観光地としていい場所だと思う」=“Yeah, the legend and all aside, I think it's a great place just as a tourist spot.”
「でも、あの鐘がなかったらわざわざ行く人って少なそうだよね」=“But, if there wasn't that bell there, I feel like not that many people would make that trek, you know?”
「そうか？　近くに灯台があるし、みんな行くと思うけど」=“You think? There's a lighthouse nearby too, so I'm pretty sure they would.”
「それにあそこは風が気持ちいいし、涼むのには最適な場所じゃないか？」=“Not to mention, the breeze there is great too, wouldn't it be perfect for cooling off?”
「確かに。暑い島だし、涼める場所として人気はありそう」=“You're not wrong. This place is pretty darn hot too, so it might be popular for that.”
「おっぱいは感度だと思うんだ」=“I think boobs are sensitive.”
「……いきなり何を言ってるんだ？　わけがわからないぞ」=“...What are you even saying? I don't even get the why of it.”
「頭ごなしに否定はしないけどさ、ちゃんと筋道を話してくれよ」=“I mean, not that I'm gonna deny it outright but, atleast explain how you got there.”
「ああ、ごめん……突然言いたくなったんだ」=“Aah, sorry... I just felt like saying it, that's all.”
「……まあ、男からしたらそうなのかもな。って、本当に思ったことを口にしただけなのかよ」=“...Well, I guess from a guy's perspective it makes sense. Wait, did you seriously just say what you were thinking, and no more?”
「うん」=“Yeah.”
「突然だけど、何かフェチってある？」=“Alright, I know it's a bit random, but what fetishes do you have?”
「本当に突然だな……んー……どうだろう？　あんまりないかも……」=“That really is random... nn... I dunno? I don't think I've got many...”
「あんまりない……ってことは、少しはあるってこと？」=“You don't have many... so you do have some?”
「そりゃまあ多少は……でも、わざわざ語って聞かせるほどじゃないな」=“Well I guess... but, it's nothing that big, not even worth talking about.”
「いや、聞かせてほしいんだ！　一生のお願い！」=“No, I wanna hear it! I won't wish for anything again in our lives, please!”
「こんなことで一生のお願いを消費する男には言いたくないって……」=“And that's exactly why I don't wanna tell you, because you're that serious about it...”
「ねえ、欲求不満な時って、どうしてるの？」=“Hey, what do you do when you feel horny?”
「はぁ……子供じゃないんだから、それぐらい想像がつくだろ？」=“Haah... we're not kids, can't you imagine that one in your head?”
「じゃあ、想像通りのことしてるってこと？」=“So, you do what I'm thinking about then?”
「そう言ってるじゃん」=“That's what I said.”
「なるほどなるほど……ふーん」=“I see I see... Hmmmmm.”
「……まあ、お前の気が済むなら、好きにすりゃいいよ」=“...Well, if it makes you happy, imagine whatever you want.”
「初めてエッチした時のことだけどさ」=“Say, about the first time we did it.”
「……そんな話、今するのか？　まぁ、別にいいけど」=“...Are we talking about that right now? Well, not that I mind, I mean.”
「もっと、こう……優しく出来たんじゃないかなって思うんだ」=“I feel like, you know... I could have been a bit gentler, for sure.”
「……そ、そうなんだ。でも、あたしは……あれで良かったって思ってるよ」=“...I-I see. But, for me... I think that was just perfect.”
「だから、なんだ？　そんなに気にしなくてもいいんじゃないか？」=“So, you know? I don't think you have to worry about it that much.”
「ありがとう。でも、男としては精進しないといけないことだから頑張るよ」=“Thanks. But, as a man it's a neverending quest so I'mma do my best.”
「……そんな決意を聞かされても、こっちは困るだけだって」=“...I'm really not sure what you want me to do with that information.”
