「この島にはたくさんのレジャーがあるよね」=“This island has all sorts of activities, doesn't it?”
「だね～。あり過ぎて飽きることなさそ～」=“Yeah~. So many I don't think we could ever get tired~”
「どんなレジャーに興味があるの？」=“What sort of activities are you interested in?”
「えっと、身体動かす系とか？　超楽しそうじゃん」=“Erhm, the more outdoorsy types? They sound so fun.”
「よし、この島にあるレジャー、全部制覇したくなって来たぞ」=“Alright, I'm starting to get into the mood to conquer all the activities this place has to offer.”
「アタシもー。絶対、全部楽しいと思うんだよねー」=“Me too~. They're all bound to be fun, aren't they~”
「この島、レジャー好きにはたまらないよね」=“For anyone who loves having fun, an island like this would just be too irresistible, wouldn't it?”
「そうだよねぇ……なんかもう、歩いてるだけでレジャーだもん」=“Yeah~... it's kinda like, just walking around feels like a fun activity, all on its own.”
「景色を見てるだけでも、遊びたくって体がウズウズしてくるよね？」=“Even just looking at the scenery's enough to make your body feel restless and make you wanna cut loose, isn't it?”
「するするぅ……なんかもう、テンション上がってきちゃうよねー」=“It really is~... It just kinda, makes you really hyped, doesn't it~”
「この島、何か珍しいレジャーとかありそうだよね」=“I feel like a place like this would have a unique, not much known sort of activity, you know?”
「あるのかな、そんなの？　アタシ、すごい気になっちゃうよー」=“You think? You're gonna make me really curious~”
「ここって、自然が豊かな島だよね」=“This island's full of nature, isn't it?”
「そだねぇ。いい所だけどちょっと暑すぎかな～」=“Yeah~. It's great but it's a bit too hot for me~”
「珍しい動物とか植物が見れたりするのかな？」=“You think we'll come across any rare animal or species?”
「見れるかなぁ……まぁ、あんま見れないから珍しいんだろうけどねー」=“Hopefully... well, they're probably rare because they're not seen often, you know~?”
「自然って好きな方？」=“You like nature?”
「好きだよー。都会に住んでるから、逆に憧れてるって感じ？」=“I do~. I've always lived in the city so, it's almost like I dream of it?”
「こういう自然な環境は、守って行きたいよね」=“It really makes you wanna protect such a nature filled environment, doesn't it?”
「ゴミのポイ捨てとかマジサイテーだよね。ちゃんとキレイにしとかないと」=“People who just chuck garbage anywhere they like are just the worst, aren't they? We gotta keep the place clean.”
「これだけ自然が豊かだと、空気も美味しい気がするよね」=“With the place this full of nature, even the air feels tasty, doesn't it?”
「するするー。空気の味わかんないけど、マジ違うって思うよ」=“It does, it really does~. I don't really get the taste bit but, it feels seriously different to me.”
「これだけ自然に囲まれてると、生活するには不便かもね」=“Living in a place so surrounded by nature might be a bit inconvenient too though, you know?”
「だよねー。アタシ近くにコンビニないと、超困ると思う」=“Yeah~. I think I'd start panicking without a convenience store nearby.”
「この辺の海は本当に水が透き通ってて綺麗だよね」=“With how see through it is, the sea looks super pretty, doesn't it?”
「アタシもそう思うよー。なんか都会の方だと水が黒いもんね」=“I think so too~. The canals in the city almost look kinda black, don't they?”
「これだけ静かだと、波の音がよく聞こえるね」=“With how quiet this place is, you can really hear the sound of the waves, can't you?”
「そうだねー。車の音とか聞こえないし、ホント、島国にいるって感じ」=“Yeah~. There's no cars either, so it seriously feels like an island country.”
「海が綺麗だと、砂浜も綺麗になるのかな」=“I wonder if the sand's so clean and pretty because the sea's so clean and pretty?”
「そんな感じするよねー。逆に砂浜が綺麗だから、海が綺麗って可能性あるかもー」=“It does feel like that, doesn't it~? It could be the reverse too though, the pretty sand making the sea all pretty~”
「この辺りの海の生き物って、カラフルなのが多いよね」=“The creatures that live in the sea here are very colorful, aren't they?”
「可愛いよねー。アタシ、熱帯魚見るの好きなんだー」=“And cute too~. I love looking at all the tropical fish~”
「この海の向こうには、色んな島や大陸があるんだろうな」=“I imagine there's a whole bunch of other islands and even continents, beyond this sea.”
「いつか行ってみたら？　船で世界一周するの、すごく楽しそうだよね」=“Why not visit them yourself someday? It sounds really fun to make a lap around the world on a ship, doesn't it?”
「この綺麗な海の底にも、変わった生き物がいるんだろうね」=“I bet there's a whole lot of weird creatures, even in the depths of a beautiful sea like this.”
「深海魚とかでしょー。アタシ、グロテスクなのはちょっと苦手かも」=“You mean the deep see fish and whatnot, right~? I don't think I'd like them very much, I'm bad with that sorta bizzare stuff.”
「自販機の飲み物も、見かけないものばっかりだよね」=“Even the vending machines are all full of stuff you'd never see in the city, aren't they?”
「アタシ、あれ買うの勇気いるんだよねー。どんな飲み物かドキドキする～」=“You really need a whole lotta courage to buy one of those, don't you~? It always makes my heart pound, imagining what it's gonna be like~”
「この島独特の調味料とかあるのかな」=“I wonder if they've got any local seasonings unique to this place?”
「あるんじゃない？　だって、味付けとか全然違うもんね」=“They probably do, no? I mean, the food tastes completely different.”
「この島の特産品ってなんなんだろう」=“I wonder what the local specialties here are.”
「サトウキビとかじゃないの？　あと、海のものとか」=“Probably the sugarcanes and whatnot, no? Oh and, stuff from the sea and whatnot.”
「この島、色んなフルーツがなってそうだよね」=“This place seems like it'd have a whole lot of fruits growing, doesn't it?”
「アタシ、野性のパイナップルって見てみたいな―。どんな風に生えてるのかな？」=“I wanna see a wild pineapple once~. I wonder how it looks on a plant?”
「この島、歩いてると良く音楽が聞こえるよね」=“Walking around the island, sometimes you can hear that music, can't you?”
「そうそう、あのすっごい陽気な曲でしょ？　テンション上がってくるよねー」=“Yepyep, you mean that super cheerful song, right? It really makes you feel energetic, doesn't it~”
「この島の伝統工芸品って、一体何になるんだろうね」=“I wonder what people even do with all the local handicrafts here.”
「わかんないけど、いっぱいありすぎて人によって答えが違うんじゃないの」=“I dunno but, there's so many, wouldn't the answer change depending on the person?”
「エッチの快感は女の方が強いって聞くけどどうなの？」=“I've heard that women experience sexual pleasure way more strongly, but is that true?”
「う、う～ん……良くわかんないけど、男みたいに弾切れはないよ？」=“N-Nnnn~... I dunno but, we don't really "run out" like men do, you know?”
「もし、自分におちんちんが生えてきたらどうする？」=“If you grew a dick out of nowhere one day, what'd you do?”
「え～……まぁ、色々弄って研究しちゃうかも？」=“Eh~... well, I might play with a bunch for research's sake, I guess?”
「エッチの時って何を考えてるの？」=“What do you usually think when we have sex?”
「えーっと……気持ちいいなぁ、とか、キミの声可愛いなぁとか、そんな感じ？」=“Erhm... "it feels so good", or, "your voice is so cute" or stuff like that, I guess?”
「そ、そんなこと答えるわけないし！」=“I-I can't even answer that anyway!”
「あ、アタシはなにも聞いてませーん！」=“I-I can't hear a thing!”
