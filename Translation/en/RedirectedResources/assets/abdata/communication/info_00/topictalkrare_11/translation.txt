「ホエールウォッチング……あれ、いいよね」=“Whale watching is... pretty nice, isn't it?”
「クジラって、可愛いわよね♪　大好きよ！」=“Whales are pretty darn adorable, aren't they?♪ I love them!”
「うん、優しい目をしてて、可愛いよね」=“Yep, they've got such gentle eyes, they're so cute.”
「あのつぶらな瞳で見つめられたら、抱きしめたくなっちゃうわ」=“If I got stared on by those big round eyes, I'm not gonna be able to hold back my urge to hug them.”
「そういえば、鯨の目の大きさってどのくらいなんだろう？」=“Come to think of it, just how big are their eyes anyway?”
「うーん、身体の割には小さく見えるけど……ボウリングの玉ぐらいかしら？」=“Nnnn, they're small compared to the rest of their bodies but... as big as a bowling ball, I suppose?”
「もし当たってたら、あんまりつぶらって感じはなくなるね」=“You won't find them as big and cute if you got hit by one of those.”
「ヤシガニって、なんかカッコイイよね」=“Coconut crabs are kinda cool, aren't they?”
「うふふ、いかにも男の子が好きそうよね、ヤシガニって」=“Ufufuh, they really are popular with boys, huh?”
「足が沢山あって、大きなハサミがあって、すごく強そうだもの」=“I can see it too, they look so tough, with all those legs and their big claws and all.”
「そう言われれば、男子のロマンが詰まってるフォルムだね」=“Now that you say it, that form's almost custom made to fire up men, isn't it?”
「……でも飼うとか言わないでちょうだいね？」=“...Don't take that as a sign to try and keep one as a pet though, okay?”
「うん……それは流石に遠慮したいかな……」=“Yeah... that would be a bit much...”
「月桃の花って綺麗だと思わない？」=“Don't you think shell gingers make for some really pretty flowers?”
「うふふ、お花を見て、素直に『綺麗』って言える人、素敵ね♪」=“Ufufuh, you can honestly call a flower pretty, suich a wonderful boy♪”
「そうかな？　なんか照れるや……」=“You think? You're gonna make me blush...”
「そうやって照れる様子も可愛い♪」=“The way you blush everytime is adorable too♪”
「もう……からかわないで……それより月桃、どう思う？」=“Jeez... don't tease me... forget that, what do you think of shell gingers?”
「う～ん、花ラッキョウみたいで可愛いわよね♪」=“Nnn~, they're adorable, aren't they? Just like shallots♪”
「花ラッキョウ……まあたしかに似てるけど……」=“Shallots... well, I mean, you're not wrong but...”
「このあたりはヤマネコの生息エリアなんだよ」=“Wildcats live in this area, did you know that?”
「大きなネコちゃんよね。ふふ、一度抱っこしてみたいわ」=“You mean the big cats, don't you? Fufuh, I wanna hold one just once.”
「止めといた方がいいよ。絶対凶暴だから」=“You probably should give up on that. It's definitely gonna claw you.”
「最初は凶暴でも、そのうちきっと慣れてくれるわよ」=“It might be a bit wary at first but, it'll get used to me in no time.”
「飼うつもり？　野生のままにしておくのが一番だよ」=“What, are you planning on keeping one as a pet? It's better to just let them be. They're wild animals.”
「……そうね。ヤマネコちゃんにとっては、きっと自然がお母さんだもんね」=“...You're right. To a little wildcat, nature itself is probably the closest thing to a mother.”
「流れ星ってロマンがあるよね」=“Shooting stars have this romantic feel to them, don't they?”
「夜空に流れる、光の奇跡……想像しただけでロマンチックな気分になっちゃう♪」=“Miracles of light, in the night sky... just thinking about them makes me feel romantic♪”
「滅多に見れないのが残念だね」=“If there's one sad thing, it's that you don't see them very often.”
「滅多に見れないからこそ、素敵なんだと思うわ」=“That's exactly why they're so lovely, I think.”
「たしかに……しょっちゅうお目にかかれたら、ありがたみがないよね」=“You've got a point... if you could see them everyday, they wouldn't feel as impressive, would they?”
「ええ、流れ星を見かけたら、しっかりと手を合わせましょうね」=“Exactly. If we ever get to see them together, let's hold hands properly, okay?”
「そういうありがたさじゃないような気がするけど……」=“I feel like this and that don't really have much of a relation but...”
「サガリバナって不思議だね。一夜だけしか咲かないんだってさ」=“Mango pines are really interesting flowers, aren't they? Apparently they only bloom for one night.”
「それは是非とも見てみたいわね。でも夜ふかしは駄目よ？」=“Oh my, I'd love to look at them atleast once too. But staying up late at night is not okay, got it?”
「どうして？　別にいいと思うけど」=“Why? I think it's fine, personally.”
「夜ふかししたら、次の日に差し障るでしょう？　寝不足は生活の質を低下させるのよ」=“If you don't get your proper sleep, you're gonna have a bad next day, no? A lack of sleep can really affect your quality of life.”
「それに、一度乱れた生活サイクルは、なかなか戻せないものよ」=“Not to mention, once you mess up your cycle once, it's really hard to get it back in order.”
（その通りかもしれないけど……過保護だなぁ）=(I mean, she's not wrong but... what a helicopter parent~)
「様子を見ていた鳥の巣で、雛がかえってたんだ」=“This birds' next I've been watching over, finally had the egg in it hatch.”
「雛ちゃんが……？　そう……」=“A little birdy...? I see...”
「あれ？　興味ない？」=“Huh? I guess it doesn't interest you?”
「……もちろん、興味はあるわ！」=“...No, of course it does!”
「可愛い可愛い生まれたての雛ちゃんなんて見たら、私、持って返っちゃうかも……」=“But if I end up laying my eyes on that adorably adorable freshly hatched birdie, I might end up taking it home with me...”
「ああ、だからそっけない態度を……」=“Aah, so that's why...”
「お願い……その可愛い雛ちゃんの話はもうしないで……」=“So please... don't talk about that adorable birdie anymore...”
「特に写真や動画なんか、絶対見せないで……絶対……お願いだから……」=“And don't show me any pictures or videos, please... you can't... that'd be too much...”
「う、うん……見せないよ」=“O-Okay... I won't, I promise you.”
（……これ『背中、押すなよ！』ってヤツかなぁ）=(...Is this one of those "Don't cheer me on, you hear me!" things?)
「民宿の庭に、アサガオが咲いたんだ。水やりしていた甲斐があったよ」=“The morning glory in the lodge's yard finally bloomed. It was worth watering it for so many days.”
「まあ……偉いわね。イイコイイコしてあげましょうか？」=“Oh my... how admirable. Want me to stroke your head as a reward?”
「はは、言葉だけで十分だよ。でも世話をすると、愛着がわくよね」=“Hahah, nah, your words are enough. But taking care of something has a way of making you real fond of it, doesn't it?”
「ええ、ことわざにもあるけど、手が掛かる子ほど可愛く感じるものよ」=“Yes, it's as the old proverb goes, the more of a handful a child is, the cuter they are.”
「あなたみたいにね？」=“Just like you, you know?”
「あはは……返す言葉に困るなぁ」=“Ahahah... I'm not sure what to say.”
「マンタって、かっこいいね」=“Mantas are pretty darn cool, aren't they?”
「意外と大きいのよね。初めてテレビで見た時、ビックリしちゃった」=“They're surprisingly big, aren't they? The first time I saw one on TV, it shocked me.”
「生まれた時に、もうすでにデッカいんだってさ」=“Apparently they're already pretty darn big by the time they're born.”
「そんな大きな赤ちゃんにミルクをあげるのって、大変そう……」=“Breastfeeding such a giant baby, must be a real handful...”
「ん？　ミルク……？　魚類なんだけど……」=“Nn? Breastfeed...? They're fish though...”
「両腕で抱えきれるかしら？　でももし双子や三つ子だったりしたら……」=“I wonder if I could hold one up in my arms? Twins or triplets would definitely be impossible, for sure...”
「……自分が母親になることを想像しなくたっていいんだよ」=“...You really don't need to imagine yourself being the mother, you know?”
「海ほたるって、昆虫の『蛍』ありきの名前だよね」=“Sea fireflies take their name from actual fireflies, don't they?”
「そうね。そっちの方が先に有名になっちゃったからでしょうね」=“Seems like it. I imagine it's because fireflies got their name first.”
「海ほたるの方が生き物としては先輩かもしれないのに」=“Even though sea fireflies might actually be older, as far as being a species goes.”
「名付けって大変なのよ。妊娠中、ずーっとそのことばかり考えるんだから」=“Coming up with new names is actually really hard, you know? People spend the entire nine months thinking of just a name.”
「……あ、『蛍』って名前、良いと思わない？　男の子にも女の子にもつけられそう」=“...Ah, don't you think "Hotaru" (firefly) is a good name? It'd work on both a boy and a girl.”
「……すかさず、自分が子供を生む時のことを考えちゃうんだね」=“...Not a moment's delay and you're already thinking about giving birth yourself, huh?”
「水中を泳ぐ亀って、優雅だよね」=“Turtles look really elegant, swimming underwater, don't they?”
「このあたりの綺麗な海なら、なおさらそう思うわよね」=“Especially when they do it in a sea as beautiful as the one they have here, don't they?”
「地上のカメは泳げないそうだけどね」=“Seems like land turtles can't really swim though.”
「寿命が長いんだから、練習すれば泳げるんじゃないかしら？」=“They've got such long lifespans, can't they learn to if they practice?”
「……どこかで習わないと駄目なんじゃないかな」=“...They'd probably have to learn it from somewhere, you know?”
「カメ用スイミングスクールを探すところから始めなきゃね」=“We're gonna have to start that quest from right at the beginning by searching for a swimming school for turtles, huh?”
「やっぱり星の砂はよく売られてるね」=“A whole lot of stores sell starsand goods here, don't they?”
「可愛らしいから、みんな欲しがってるのよ」=“Everyone wants a few, you know? Starsand just looks so cute.”
「もう買ったの？」=“Have you bought something already?”
「ええ、今も持ち歩いているわ。あなたも一つどうかしら？」=“Yes, I'm carrying one even now. How about you buy a thing or two for yourself?”
「うーん……記念になるし、買っておこうかな」=“Nnn... maybe I will, it'll make for a good keepsake, I guess.”
「うふふ、お仲間ゲットね♪　お揃いにしましょう？」=“Ufufuh, another comrade♪ Let's get matching things?”
「ウムイの鐘のジンクスって、どう思う？」=“What do you think of the legend behind the Bell of Umuy?”
「うふふ、いかにも女性が好みそうな噂よね」=“Ufufuh, it really is the sort of thing to make a girl swoon, isn't it?”
「鐘を鳴らして、別れたカップルも多そうだけどね」=“Yeah but you just know there's lots of couples out there that rang it and then split up, you know?”
「そういうことは言わないの」=“Don't say such things.”
「鐘を鳴らした時に感じる幸福感……それだけは真実でしょう？」=“No matter how things are after... the happiness you feel when you ring it is not a lie, no?”
「……そうだね、その通りだ」=“...Yeah, it's exactly as you say.”
「……おっぱい」=“...Boobs.”
「うふふ、おっぱいがどうかしたの？」=“Ufufuh, what about them?”
「え？　俺、口に出してた？」=“Eh? Did I say that outloud?”
「そんなにミルクが飲みたいの？」=“Do you want some milk that badly?”
「おっぱい＝母乳って考え方なんだね……」=“So that's what boobs are to you, huh?...”
「ええ。他に何があるの？」=“Yes. What else would they be?”
「い、いや……別に、ない……かな」=“N-No, well... nothing, really... I guess.”
「フェチって、どう思う？」=“What do you think of fetishes?”
「あら、エッチな話？　もう……男の子って、すぐそういうこと言うんだから」=“Oh my, lewd talk? Jeez... boys just can't help themselves, huh?”
「……そういう話、苦手？」=“...You don't like it?”
「んー、苦手じゃないけど……でも、時と場所はわきまえないといけないわ」=“Nnn, I wouldn't say so that... but, you gotta learn the best time and place for everything.”
「大人の意見、ありがとう……じゃあ、また改めて」=“Thank you for your adult opinion... do be seeing you.”
「うふふ、拗ねないの。そういう顔、大好き……ちょっと興奮しちゃう♪」=“Ufufuh, don't sulk. I love that expression of yours... it's a bit arousing~♪”
「……図らずも、フェチシズムの話になっちゃった」=“...Somehow, it came back to fetishes.”
「ねえ、欲求不満になった時はどうするの？」=“Hey, what do you do when you feel sexually frustrated?”
「もう、すぐそういうこと言うんだから。メッよ」=“Jeez, you always talk about that stuff. Stop being bad.”
「あ、ごめん……ちょっと気になって……」=“Ah, sorry... I just got a bit curious...”
「……きっと想像通りよ。だから、わざわざ話さなくてもいいかなって」=“...It's probably what you're imagining, I'm sure. So I don't really think you need to ask me that stuff.”
「想像通り？　うわぁ、すごい……」=“What I'm imagining? Uwah, damn...”
「うーん……どういう想像してるのかしら。予想と違う反応だわ」=“Nnn... just what are you imagining, actually? I didn't expect that reaction.”
「初めて、エッチした時のことだけど……」=“The first time we had sex...”
「どうして、そんなお話をするの？」=“Why're we talking about that?”
「いや、その……不意に思い出しちゃったんだ」=“No, well... It just came to mind, that's all.”
「……まあ、そういうこともあるわよね。ふふ、とても素敵だったわ」=“...Well, I suppose that does happen. Fufuh, it was wonderful.”
「やさしくて、それでいて逞しくて……あなたが初めての相手でよかった」=“You were so gentle, yet so manly... I'm glad you were my first.”
「ふ～ん……そっか」=“Nnn~... I see.”
「それで？　何が聞きたかったのかしら？」=“So, what was it that you wanted to ask?”
「……ん、もういい。だいたい聞けたいこと、聞けたからね」=“...Nn, nothing, it's fine. I already got the answer to it anyway.”
