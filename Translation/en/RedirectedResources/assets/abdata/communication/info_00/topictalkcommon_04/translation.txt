「外で遊ぶのって好き？」=“Do you like having fun outside?”
「汗を流すのは気持ちいいし、割と好きね」=“I really like sweating a bunch, so I actually do.”
「屋内で出来るレジャーも豊富だったらいいのにね」=“If only they had just as many indoor activities to do too, that'd be so nice.”
「天気が悪い日の為に必要かもね」=“Might come in handy on days with bad weather, yeah.”
「この島が楽し過ぎて、ずっと遊んでたくなるな……」=“This island's so fun, I just can't help but want to mess around all day...”
「気持ちは分かるけど、本来の目的を忘れちゃダメよ？」=“I get how you feel but, don't forget the reason we actually came here, alright?”
「ずっとこの島にいたら、運動不足とは無縁だろうなぁ」=“If we just stayed on this island, I bet we'd never suffer from a lack of exercise, atleast.”
「ふふ、確かに。自然豊かだし、健康的でいられそうだわ」=“Fufuh, for sure. There's so much nature around here too, I feel like we'd be able to live a pretty healthy lifestyle.”
「だいたいのアクティビティはやってみた？」=“Tried out most of the activities here?”
「ううん、まだ全然。でも、それだけ楽しみが残ってるってことだから、ワクワクしてるわ」=“Nope, not at all. But, that just means that there's just that many more things to do, so I'm pretty excited.”
「やっぱり男は筋肉があった方がいいのかな？」=“Do you think men should be muscly after all?”
「私が頷いたら筋トレをするの？　ふふ、それなら『うん』って答えようかな」=“Would you hit the gym if I were to say yes? Fufuh, in that case, maybe I just will.”
「飼ってみたい動物や、育ててみたい植物ってある？」=“Is there any animal you want to have, or any plant you want to try raising?”
「植物には明るくないから分からないけど……動物ならモモンガかな。変わった動物を飼ってみたいわ」=“I'm really not knowledgeable about plants, so I dunno but... as for pets, I'd like a flying squirrel. I like weird animals.”
「道端の草花も、なんていうか南の島特有の感じがするよね」=“Even the flowers on the roadside feel pretty southern, don't they?”
「ふふ、言いたいことは分かるけど、すごく抽象的ね」=“Fufuh, I get what you're trying to say but, what a way to say it.”
「自然の中にいると、心が清らかになってく気がするんだ」=“Taking walks out within nature really makes my heart feel cleaner.”
「なぁに？　あなたは普段、闇を抱えて生きてるの？」=“What~? Do you normally walk around with darkness in there?”
「今日も空が澄んでて綺麗だね」=“Another day with a beautiful clear sky, huh?”
「そうね。この旅行は本当に天気に恵まれていてよかったわ」=“Yeah. Thank god that this trip's been so blessed with the weather so far.”
「余生はこういう自然に囲まれたところで暮らしたいな……」=“Man, I wanna retire and spend the last few years of my life in a place like this...”
「もう……そんなことを考えるような歳じゃないでしょ？」=“Jeez... are you really old enough to be thinking about that sorta stuff?”
「これだけ緑が綺麗だから、精霊とかそういうのがいてもおかしくない気がするなぁ」=“With how pretty all the nature is here, I feel like the spirits of the dead wouldn't really look all that out of place either.”
「ふふ、私達が気づいてないだけで、案外近くにいるのかもしれないわね」=“Fufuh, they might be pretty darn up close with us just not realizing that they're there, you know?”
「海と聞いて、なにを連想する？」=“What does the word "sea" bring to mind for you?”
「やっぱり夏休みかしら。夏以外に訪れる機会は、めったにないから」=“The summer vacation, has to be. Not like there's any other time in the year that anyone really visits one.”
「熱帯魚がどうしてあんなにカラフルなんだろうね？」=“I wonder why tropical fishes are so colorful?”
「うーん、保護色だから……とか？　勘だけど、いい線いっている気がするわ」=“Nnnn, camoflage... maybe? It's just a hunch but, I feel like I'm along the right lines there.”
「深海魚って可愛いと思う？」=“Do you think deep sea fishes are cute?”
「私は嫌いじゃないわ。どんな進化を経たのか想像すると楽しいしね」=“I don't hate them. It's pretty fun to imagine too, just what sort of evolution they went through.”
「綺麗な海を泳ぐのって気持ちいいよね」=“Swimming along such a beautiful sea feels great, doesn't it?”
「ええ、本当にそう思うわ。海中を優雅に泳ぐことが出来たら、もっと素敵なんでしょうね」=“Yes, it really does. I imagine it'd feel even more wonderful, if we could swim gracefully underwater.”
「魚を見てさ、綺麗だと思う？　それとも美味しそうだと思う？」=“When you look at a fish, which word pops into your head? "Pretty"? Or "delicious"?”
「それは……種類によるかな？　熱帯魚なら綺麗だと思うけど、マグロとかなら味を想像しちゃうかも」=“That's... dependent upon the kind of fish, I guess? If it was a tropical fish, I'd think "pretty" but, if it was tuna I think I'd just imagine the taste.”
「海辺の近くに住んだら、綺麗な景色を毎日眺められるんだよね……いいなぁ」=“If we lived near a beach like this, we'd get to see a view like this everyday, wouldn't we... that'd be so nice.”
「そうね。でも特別な景色が当たり前になるのは、ちょっと勿体ない気がするわ。たまに訪れるぐらいがいいのかもしれないわね」=“Yeah. But having such a special view like this turn into a boring everyday thing, feels like a waste. Coming here to savour it like this every so often might just be the perfect thing.”
「ここら辺って長寿の人が多いけど、食べてる料理のお陰だったりするのかな？」=“There's a whole lot of long living people here, you think it's the food?”
「その可能性は高そうな気がするわね。同じ食事を続けていたら、私達も長生き出来るかしら」=“I wouldn't be surprised, seems pretty likely. I wonder if we'd live long too, if we kept eating the same food?”
「色んなフルーツジュースを見かけるよね」=“There's all kinds of fruit juice to be had here, huh?”
「さすが南国って感じがするわ。せっかくだし、私も色々頼んでみようかしら」=“It really does feel like a southern country. We're here anyway, so maybe I'll try a bunch of it out too.”
「なにか気になる特産品とかあった？」=“Anything local that really caught your eye?”
「普段目にしないものばかりだから、どれも気になってるわ。一つに搾るのは難しいわね」=“The place is full of stuff that I normally never see so, everything's caught my eye. I can't really pick out one specific thing.”
「こっちの方言で『すごい』は『ちびらーさん』って言うらしいよ」=“Apparently in the local dialect, they say "chibiraasan" for "amazing".”
「へぇ、名産品とかに使ったら喜んでもらえそうね」=“Heh, I bet it'd make their faces light up if I used it for a local product.”
「お店を見て回るだけでも楽しいよね」=“It's fun to just make the rounds of all the shops, isn't it?”
「見ていて全然飽きないわよね。お金があれば、全部買ってるんだけど……叶わない願いね」=“It never gets tiring, does it? If I had the money, I'd buy it all... sadly, that's never gonna happen.”
「買い物はもう済んだ？」=“Have you already done all your shopping?”
「ううん、まだ迷ってる最中なの。最終的な候補は絞れたから、あともう少しで決まるところよ」=“Nope, I'm still considering stuff. I've more or less whittled down my list to the last few contenders, so just a bit more and I'll be done.”
「オナニーするのは好き？」=“Do you like masturbating?”
「……き、気持ち良くなれるから、嫌いじゃないけど……もう、女の子に聞く事じゃないわ」=“...I-It feels good so, I don't hate it but... jeez, you really shouldn't ask a girl this.”
「チンコの話なんだけど、硬いのと太いのはどっちが好き？」=“On dicks, do you prefer a hard one or a fat one?”
「け、経験が豊富なわけじゃないから、分からないわ。……あなたのは、好き……だけど」=“I-I really don't have much experience in that department, you know that. ...Though, I do like... yours.”
「変わったエッチってしてみたい？」=“You wanna try out some freaky sex?”
「それは……エッチの内容によるわ。無茶なことは、しないでね？」=“That... would depend upon what it is. Don't do anything, too absurd to me, okay?”
「ちょっと、変なことを言わないで」=“Hey, don't ask such weird things.”
「……今の発言は、聞かなかったことにするわ」=“...I'll pretend I didn't hear you say that.”
