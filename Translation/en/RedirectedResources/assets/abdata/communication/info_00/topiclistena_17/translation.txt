「<color%3Dyellow>釣り</color>って割と好きなのよね」=“I actually really like <color%3Dyellow>fishing</color>, you know?”
「魚との駆け引きが、意外とのめり込むのよ」=“The back and forth as you pull and get pulled by the fish is actually surprisingly intense.”
「<color%3Dyellow>シュノーケリング</color>って、結構いいと思うわ」=“<color%3Dyellow>Snorkeling</color> is really nice, in my opinion.”
「手軽に海と一つになれる感じが、悪くないと思うわ」=“The way it lets you become one with the sea with so little effort, is pretty nice.”
「そう、それもいいかも知れないわね」=“I see, that might be nice as well.”
「ふぅん、そっちもなかなか悪くないかも知れないわね」=“Hmmm, that might be pretty nice too.”
「そう。でも、試してみたら、案外気に入るかも知れないわよ」=“I see. But, you might actually like it, if you try it.”
「気に入らなかった？　大丈夫よ、その内好きになるわ」=“Couldn't catch your interest? Don't worry, you'll fall in love with it eventually.”
「<color%3Dyellow>水牛</color>って、意外と可愛いわよね」=“<color%3Dyellow>Water buffalos</color> are surprisingly cute, aren't they?”
「よくよく見ると、結構つぶらな瞳をしているのよ」=“You'll find that they've actually got quite the adorable eyes, if you take a close look at them.”
「私、実は<color%3Dyellow>ネコ</color>が好きなのよ」=“I actually really love <color%3Dyellow>cats.</color>”
「気まぐれだけど、意外と甘え上手な所が、憎めないのよね」=“They're very fickle things but, they love it when you spoil them too, and I just can't hate that.”
「<color%3Dyellow>ハイビスカス</color>って、いい花だと思わない？」=“Don't you think <color%3Dyellow>Hibiscuses</color> are pretty nice flowers?”
「一見華やかだけど、何となく清楚な雰囲気があるのよね」=“They're very show on the surface but, they've got a really neat and tidy feeling to them at the same time, you know?”
「この島の<color%3Dyellow>星空</color>ってすごく素敵よね」=“The <color%3Dyellow>starry sky</color> here is really beautiful, isn't it?”
「やっぱり緯度が違うから、星の見え方も普段と違うのよね」=“It really looks different too, I suppose that's the latitude difference at work.”
「そういう事ね。その楽しみ方は知らなかったわ」=“I see. I didn't know you could do that as well.”
「なるほどね。変わった見方だと思うけど、面白そうだわ」=“Makes sense. I think it's a pretty unusual way of thinking about it, but it's interesting.”
「自然は色んな見方ができるんだから、きっと魅力に気づくはずよ」=“Nature lets you look at things from all sorts of viewpoints, so I'm sure you'll realize the charm of it soon enough.”
「興味がないって顔ね？　でも、きっと気に入ると思うわよ」=“You don't seem very interested there. But, I'm sure you'll come to like it.”
「<color%3Dyellow>チンアナゴ</color>って面白いと思わない？」=“Don't you think that <color%3Dyellow>spotted garden eels</color> are really interesting?”
「あのフラフラ揺れてる姿が、なんだかとっても可愛いと思うわ」=“The way they move around is just, somehow so cute to me.”
「私、<color%3Dyellow>クマノミ</color>って好きなのよ」=“I love <color%3Dyellow>clownfish.</color>”
「泳ぎが苦手なのに、頭がいいのよね。共生なんてよく考えられてると思うわ」=“Even though they're bad at swimming, they've got good heads. I'm surprised they came up with something like symbiosis.”
「確かにそうね。その魅力は気が付かなかったわ」=“You're not wrong. I never realized the charm of that.”
「ふぅん、なかなか変わったとらえ方ね……でも、面白そう」=“Hmmm, that's a pretty unusual way of looking at it... but, it does sound interesting.”
「そうなのね……海は広くて奥が深いんだから、もっと興味を持った方がいいわよ」=“Of course... the sea is as wide as it is deep so, you're losing out really.”
「今は分からなくてもいいわ。楽しみは後にとっておいた方がいいのかも知れないし」=“It's fine if you don't get it yet. Who knows, you might enjoy it a lot more later.”
「やっぱり、何か<color%3Dyellow>名物料理</color>は食べておいた方がいいわよね」=“We really should eat some <color%3Dyellow>local cuisine</color> while we're here, shouldn't we?”
「地元の料理は、その地元で食べるのが一番いいと思うわ」=“I think it's best to sample a region's food in that very region itself.”
「<color%3Dyellow>シーサー</color>っていいわよね。私、好きよ」=“<color%3Dyellow>Shisas</color> are really nice, aren't they? I love them.”
「あんなに可愛いのに魔除けにもなるなんて、すごいと思うわ」=“I think it's really amazing, how they stave off even spirits despite being so adorable.”
「そんなものもあったなんて、なんだかすごいわね」=“I can't believe they have something like that too, it's kind of amazing, isn't it?”
「意外だったけど、それもいいわね」=“I didn't expect that, but that's pretty interesting as well.”
「難しいものね……魅力を誰かに伝えるのって」=“It's so difficult, isn't it... to express the charm of something to someone.”
「悪くないと思ってたんだけど……少し、分かりづらかったかしら？」=“I liked it a fair bit, personally... was my explanation not clear somehow?”
