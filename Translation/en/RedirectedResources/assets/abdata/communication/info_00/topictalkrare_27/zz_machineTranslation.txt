「ホエールウォッチングってどんなイメージ？」=“What do you think of whale watching?”
「イメージって……普通に、船で寄っていって近くでクジラを見るんでしょ？」=“What's it like to go whale watching on a ...... boat and see the whales up close?”
「結構、運要素が高そうじゃない？」=“There's a lot of luck involved, isn't there?”
「それはそうでしょ。クジラが止まって待っててくれるわけじゃないんだし」=“That's true. It's not like the whale is going to stop and wait for you.”
「クジラが無理でも、クジラ以外に何か見られないかな」=“Even if we can't see whales, what else can we see?”
「……海鳥とか？」=“Like ...... seabirds?”

「ああ、ちっちゃい花が並んでるから」=“Yeah, it's just a bunch of little flowers.”
「ちょっと和菓子みたいよね」=“It's a little like Japanese sweets.”
「花なんだから、実際に口に入れても甘いかもね？」=“They're flowers, so maybe they're sweet in your mouth?”
「かもしれないわね。試す気はないけど」=“Maybe. I'm not going to try it.”
「ヤマネコって飼うの大変そうだよね」=“Bobcats are hard to keep, aren't they?”

「どうって？」=“What do you mean?”
「わざわざ私に言うくらいだから綺麗だったんでしょ？」=“I mean, you went to a lot of trouble to tell me, so it must have been beautiful.”

「まあ、迫力はあるかも？　あの大きさだもの」=“Yeah, they can be powerful.　I mean, they're that big.”
「マンタと人間が一緒に映ってる写真見て、ちょっと引いたよ」=“I've seen pictures of manta rays and people together and it's kind of disturbing.”
「大きいのだと、５メートルくらいのサイズだって見た気がするわ」=“I think I've seen some of the biggest ones, like five meters.”

「無粋なことは言わなくていいの。目に映っている光景が綺麗なら、それで充分だわ」=“You don't have to be so tactful. You don't need to be tactful, as long as the sight you see is beautiful, that's all that matters.”
「それもそっか」=“I see.”
