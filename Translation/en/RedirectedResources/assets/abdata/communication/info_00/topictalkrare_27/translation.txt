「ホエールウォッチングってどんなイメージ？」=“What kind of image do you have of whale watching?”
「イメージって……普通に、船で寄っていって近くでクジラを見るんでしょ？」=“Whale watching... you usually go by boat to see the whales up close, right?”
「結構、運要素が高そうじゃない？」=“Seems like there's a lot of luck involved, isn't there?”
「それはそうでしょ。クジラが止まって待っててくれるわけじゃないんだし」=“That's true. It's not like the whales will stop and wait for us.”
「クジラが無理でも、クジラ以外に何か見られないかな」=“Even if we can't see the whales, is there anything else we can see?”
「……海鳥とか？」=“...seabirds, maybe?”
「バードウォッチングか……それもいいのかも」=“Birdwatching... that wouldn't be so bad.”
「ヤシガニって挟まれたら痛そうだよね」=“I'm thinking it'd hurt to be pinched by a palm crab.”
「痛いなんかじゃ済まないわよ。最悪、指が落ちるって聞いたことあるわ」=“It's more than just gonna hurt. I heard that they can snip your fingers right off.”
「破壊力あるなぁ……」=“How destructive...”
「だって、自分の顔より大きいハサミがついてるのよ」=“I mean, they've got pincers on them that are bigger than my face.”
「もしどこかで鉢合わせしたら守ってもらわないと」=“If I run into one somewhere, you'll have to protect me.”
「私があんたを守るわけ！？」=“How am I supposed to protect you!?”
「月桃ってキレイな花だよね」=“Shell gingers are beautiful flowers, aren't they?”
「キレイというよりは、可愛らしい花って印象を持ったけど」=“To me, it's more of a pretty flower than a beautiful one.”
「ああ、ちっちゃい花が並んでるから」=“Ahhh, it's just a bunch of little flowers.”
「ちょっと和菓子みたいよね」=“They kinda look a little like Japanese sweets.”
「花なんだから、実際に口に入れても甘いかもね？」=“They're flowers, so maybe they're actually sweet enough to put in your mouth?”
「かもしれないわね。試す気はないけど」=“Possibly. I'm not going to try it.”
「ヤマネコって飼うの大変そうだよね」=“Wildcats are hard to keep as pets, aren't they?”
「飼っちゃダメなんでしょ？　だいたい、飼えるような生き物じゃないわよ」=“You know you're not supposed to keep them, right? They're not critters you can keep as pets.”
「……強そうだからね」=“...they look powerful.”
「そうそう、あんたみたいな軟弱者ひっかかれるに決まってるわ」=“Yeah, well, they're bound to scratch a softy like you.”
「理由もなく？」=“For no reason?”
「ゲーム感覚よ。子供がじゃれあって狩りの練習するような感じで」=“It's a game to them. It's like kids playing with each other, practicing hunting.”
「じゃあ、飼うのは止めようかな……」=“Well, I don't think I'll keep one...”
「だから、そもそも飼えないでしょ」=“Look, you can't keep them in the first place.”
「流れ星にお願いすることって、ちゃんと考えてある？」=“Do you have a good wish prepared for wishing on a shooting star?”
「ちゃんとって何よ……」=“What do you mean, 'prepared'...”
「いざって時、慌てないように？」=“So you don't panic when the time comes?”
「バカバカしいわね。私は神頼みとか星頼みとかを前提に生きてないの」=“That's ridiculous. I don't live my life on the premise of asking God, or the stars, for help.”
「叶えたいことがあったら自分で叶えるわ」=“If I want something to happen, I'll make it happen myself.”
「不老不死とかでも？」=“Like immortality?”
「……そんなの流れ星だって叶えてくれないわよ」=“Even a shooting star can't make that happen.”
「ひとつくらいあるでしょ？　自分じゃどうにもならないけど叶えたいこと」=“But there's always something, right?　Something you can't control, but you want to want to make happen.”
「なら……宝くじ一等とか？」=“Like... winning the lottery?”
「急に現実的」=“Now you're being realistic.”
「サガリバナを見てみたいって思う？」=“Think you like to see a sagaribana?”
「咲くところをってこと？　……そうね」=“You mean do I want to see it bloom?　...sure.”
「あんまり気乗りしない？」=“Not really into it?”
「そういうわけじゃないけど、なんだかエピソードが悲劇的でしょう？」=“That's not it, it's more the whole thing's so tragic, somehow.”
「もうすぐ花が落ちちゃうのねって思いながら見てたら、寂しくなりそう」=“If you look at them, knowing that the flower's going to wilt soon, it makes you feel lonely.”
（乙女だ……）=(She's such a maiden...)
「この前、こっそりチェックしてた鳥の巣で雛が孵ってたよ」=“I was peeking in on bird's nest the other day, and the chicks were hatching.”
「チェックって何よ。あんた監視員？」=“What do you mean, 'peek'? Are you a peeping Tom?”
「そんな突き放したこと言っていいのかな？　すっごい可愛いのになー」=“I wouldn't be that blunt about it, okay?　Anyway, they're very cute.”
「……うっ」=“...uuuu.”
「ちっちゃいぞー」=“And so tiny-.”
「そ、その言い草、もしかして……」=“Th-the way you're talking...”
「動画あるよ。ちゃんとさっきの態度を謝ったら……」=“I made a video of it. If you apologize for your earlier behavior...”
「ごめんなさい！　早くそれ見せて」=“I'm sorry!　Show it to me.”
（いつもそれぐらい素直ならいいのに）=(I wish she was always that honest...)
「知ってる？　民宿の庭のアサガオが咲いたんだよ」=“You know what?　The morning glories in the inn's garden have bloomed.”
「ふぅん、そうなのね」=“Hmph, is that so.”
「あんまり興味ないのか。実は俺、こっそり水をあげたりしてたんだよね……」=“So, that doesn't interest you. You know, I've been secretly watering them, and stuff.”
「自分の家でもないのに？」=“And it's not even your house, is it?”
「そう言われるとそうなんだけど、なんだか気になって」=“Well, that is true, but I was concerned about them, for some reason.”
「あんたも物好きね。それで……どうだったの？」=“I'm a sucker for a good story. So... how did it go?”
「どうって？」=“What do you mean?”
「わざわざ私に言うくらいだから綺麗だったんでしょ？」=“I mean, you went to a lot of trouble to tell me, so they must be beautiful.”
「ああ、うん。綺麗な花をつけたよ」=“Ahh, yeah. They have beautiful flowers.”
「そう……じゃあ、機会があったら見ておくわ」=“So... well, I'll check them out, if I get the chance.”
「マンタって名前はほんわかしてるけど、見た目はいかついよね」=“Manta rays may have a friendly name, but they look tough.”
「まあ、迫力はあるかも？　あの大きさだもの」=“Well, they're powerful, aren't they?　And they're big.”
「マンタと人間が一緒に映ってる写真見て、ちょっと引いたよ」=“I've seen pictures of manta rays and people next to each other, and I was taken back a little.”
「大きいのだと、５メートルくらいのサイズだって見た気がするわ」=“I think I've seen one as big as 5 meters.”
「2階建ての建物くらいかな？　５メートルって」=“Isn't like a two-story building?　Five meters.”
「そう聞くと巨大ね。人が住めちゃうんだ……」=“That is huge, when you put it that way. People could live on its back...”
「住むって背中に？」=“Live on its back?”
「海ほたるって神秘的だよね」=“Sea fireflies are mysterious, aren't they?”
「そうね。確かこの島でも見れるんでしょ？」=“Yeah. I'm pretty sure you can see them around the island, right?”
「だね。でも、海ほたるの正体を知ってると……」=“True. But, when you learn what sea fireflies really are...”
「無粋なことは言わなくていいの。目に映っている光景が綺麗なら、それで充分だわ」=“No need to be so tactful. If the sight of them is beautiful, that's enough for me.”
「それもそっか」=“Sure, that's right.”
「今度から、空気を読まないことは言わない様に気を付けなさい」=“Next time, try not to say anything offensive.”
「肝に銘じます……」=“I'll keep that in mind...”
「ウミガメっていうと思い出すのは、やっぱり産卵かな」=“When I think of sea turtles, I think of them laying eggs.”
「そうね、涙を流しながら卵を産んでるシーンとかやっぱり連想しちゃうわ」=“Right, I think of them laying eggs with tears in their eyes.”
「どんな生き物も女性は大変だ……」=“All female creatures have it tough.”
「ふぅん、随分としおらしいことを言うじゃない」=“Hmph, that's very noble thing to say.”
「俺だったらせめて、そばについててあげたいかな」=“If it were up to me, I'd at least be there for her.”
「手でも握ってくれるの？　励ましたり」=“Would you hold my hand?　To cheer me up.”
「……握ろうか？」=“...want me to hold it?”
「あんたと私って意味で言ったわけじゃないわよ！　一般論」=“I didn't mean you and me!　In general.”
「星の砂っていいネーミングだと思わない？」=“ 'Star sand' is a good name, don't you think?”
「上から目線……まあ、言いたいことはわかるけど」=“You're being condescending... well, I understand what you mean.”
「ロマンチックな響きをしてるし……」=“It has a romantic ring to it...”
「もう買った？」=“Have you bought any yet?”
「もうって何よ。ああいうのは、自分で買うものじゃないでしょ？」=“What the hell? That's not something you buy for yourself, you know?”
（プレゼントしたら喜ぶかな……）=(I wonder if she'd like it as a gift...)
「ウムイの鐘ってどの段階で成立してるんだと思う？」=“I wonder at what stage we've established with the Umui Bell?”
「ちょっと言ってることがわからないわ」=“I kind of don't know what you're talking about.”
「いつ、二人で鳴らしたことになるのかなぁって。音が鳴った時？　何回鳴らすの？」=“I was just wondering when the effects kick in? When you hear the sound? How many times to we need to ring it?”
「……あんたって意外と細かい性格なの？」=“...you're a real stickler for details, aren't you?”
「間違いがあったら嫌だし」=“I'd hate to make a mistake.”
「なんの意気込みよ……」=“What's with that enthusiasm...”
「おっぱいに一番近い感触って、女性目線だとなんだと思う？」=“From a woman's perspective, what's the closest you can get to a pair of boobs?”
「なな、何を聞いてるのよ！　あんた、気は確か？」=“Whoa, whoa, what are you asking me! You crazy, or something?”
「いたって健常だよ。それで、どうかな？」=“I'm perfectly healthy. So, what do you think?”
「どうって言われても……分からないわよ」=“Even if you ask again... I don't know.”
「触ってみれば俺も同じ目線で悩めるようになると思うんだけど」=“I believe if I touch yours, I'll be able to see things the same way you do, and then worry about them the same way you do.”
「この流れで触ってきたら叩くからね？」=“If you touch me like that, I'll slap you, okay?”
「フェチも色々あるけど、引くようなものってある？」=“There are all kinds of fetishes. Are there any you could pull off?”
「山ほどあるでしょ。ほら……いじめるのが好きとか？」=“There are a lot. Hey... I hear you like to tease, don't you?”
「あれ、そういうタイプじゃないの？」=“So that's not your thing?”
「当たり前でしょ！　私はあんたと違って普通なの」=“Of course not!　I'm not like you. I'm normal.”
「ん？　俺は何フェチだと思われてるの？」=“Nh?　Then what fetish do you think you have?”
「わ、わかんないけど、とにかくエッチよ！」=“I-I don't know, but I'm into sex!”
「それは男なら誰でもそうです」=“That's true for every man.”
「欲求不満にさせない様に、俺は頑張るよ」=“I'll do my best to make sure you're not frustrated.”
「ななな、何の決意表明よ！？」=“Wh-wh-what are you saying!?”
「どこがとは言わないけど、乾く間もないくらいに――」=“I won't say where, but I'll never let it get dry--”
「意味がわかんないことを口走ろうとしないで！」=“Quit blurting out nonsense!”
「……俺が何を言おうとしたか分かったから、遮ったんじゃないの？」=“...you got what I meant, which is why you interrupted me, isn't it?”
「エッチ！　バカ！　スケベ！」=“Pervert!　Idiot!　Moron!”
「その……俺と初めてした時のこと、覚えてる？」=“So, uh... you remember the first time you did it with me?”
「きゅ、急に何を言い出すわけ！？」=“Kyu, what are you talking about?!”
「ああ、いや……変な意味じゃなくてさ……痛くなかったかなとか思ったりして……」=“Ah, no... I didn't mean anything weird... I was just wondering if it hurt, or anything...”
「そ、そういうことね……」=“I-I see what you're getting at...”
「まぁ、痛かったけど、それ以上に……」=“Well, it did hurt, but more than that...”
「それ以上に？」=“More than what?”
「何でもない！　何でもないわ！」=“It's nothing!　It's totally nothing!”
「えぇっ！？　気になるんだけど……」=“Ehhh!?　Now I'm curious...”
「そんなこと聞くなんて、デリカシーがないわよ！」=“Asking me that... you completely lack delicacy!”
