「ホエールウォッチングってどんなイメージ？」=“What sort of image do you have, of whale watching?”
「イメージって……普通に、船で寄っていって近くでクジラを見るんでしょ？」=“What sort... it's just getting up close to a whale on a ship and looking at it, no?”
「結構、運要素が高そうじゃない？」=“Doesn't that sound like mostly luck?”
「それはそうでしょ。クジラが止まって待っててくれるわけじゃないんだし」=“Well, yeah. It's not like a whale's gonna stop and wait in one spot just for us.”
「クジラが無理でも、クジラ以外に何か見られないかな」=“Even if we can't see a whale, you think we'd get to see something else atleast?”
「……海鳥とか？」=“...What, like a seabird or something?”
「バードウォッチングか……それもいいのかも」=“From whale watching to bird watching... that might be nice too.”
「ヤシガニって挟まれたら痛そうだよね」=“Being scissored by a coconut crab would probably hurt a lot, wouldn't it?”
「痛いなんかじゃ済まないわよ。最悪、指が落ちるって聞いたことあるわ」=“Pain's gonna be the least of your worries. I've heard that in the worst cases, they can lop off whole fingers.”
「破壊力あるなぁ……」=“That's some power...”
「だって、自分の顔より大きいハサミがついてるのよ」=“Well, their claws are bigger than our faces, you know?”
「もしどこかで鉢合わせしたら守ってもらわないと」=“Man, if we end up butting heads with one somehow, I'm gonna hide behind you.”
「私があんたを守るわけ！？」=“I'm the one who's gotta protect you!?”
「月桃ってキレイな花だよね」=“Shell gingers are some really pretty flowers, aren't they?”
「キレイというよりは、可愛らしい花って印象を持ったけど」=“Rather than "pretty", in my head they've always been more "adorable".”
「ああ、ちっちゃい花が並んでるから」=“Aah, because of how all the tiny flowers line up together, I'm guessing?”
「ちょっと和菓子みたいよね」=“They kinda look like a bunch of sweets, don't they?”
「花なんだから、実際に口に入れても甘いかもね？」=“They're flowers so, they might actually be pretty sweet, you know?”
「かもしれないわね。試す気はないけど」=“They might just be. Not that I plan on testing that.”
「ヤマネコって飼うの大変そうだよね」=“It seems like a lot of work to keep a wildcat around as a pet, doesn't it?”
「飼っちゃダメなんでしょ？　だいたい、飼えるような生き物じゃないわよ」=“You can't actually keep one, no? To begin with, it's not really the sort of animal you keep.”
「……強そうだからね」=“...It does look pretty tough.”
「そうそう、あんたみたいな軟弱者ひっかかれるに決まってるわ」=“Exactly, a sissy like you would get clawed for sure.”
「理由もなく？」=“For no reason?”
「ゲーム感覚よ。子供がじゃれあって狩りの練習するような感じで」=“Think of it like a videogame. You'd be a tutorial hunt for their litter.”
「じゃあ、飼うのは止めようかな……」=“Then, maybe I'll give up on getting one...”
「だから、そもそも飼えないでしょ」=“Like I said, you can't get one.”
「流れ星にお願いすることって、ちゃんと考えてある？」=“Have you seriously thought of a wish, to wish upon a shooting star?”
「ちゃんとって何よ……」=“What "seriously"...”
「いざって時、慌てないように？」=“So that you don't have to rush to think of one, if it does happen?”
「バカバカしいわね。私は神頼みとか星頼みとかを前提に生きてないの」=“So ridiculous. I don't live my life believing in the gods or the stars or whatever else.”
「叶えたいことがあったら自分で叶えるわ」=“If there's something I want to happen, I'll make it come true myself.”
「不老不死とかでも？」=“Even immortality?”
「……そんなの流れ星だって叶えてくれないわよ」=“...Even a shooting star wouldn't make a wish like that come true.”
「ひとつくらいあるでしょ？　自分じゃどうにもならないけど叶えたいこと」=“You should have one or two things, no? Things that you can't do anything about but you want them to come true.”
「なら……宝くじ一等とか？」=“In that case... a winning lottery ticket?”
「急に現実的」=“And there we go.”
「サガリバナを見てみたいって思う？」=“You think you wanna go see a mango pine?”
「咲くところをってこと？　……そうね」=“You mean seeing them bloom? ...I guess, yeah.”
「あんまり気乗りしない？」=“Not very into it, are you?”
「そういうわけじゃないけど、なんだかエピソードが悲劇的でしょう？」=“That's not it, it's just a tragic sorta thing, no?”
「もうすぐ花が落ちちゃうのねって思いながら見てたら、寂しくなりそう」=“I feel like I'd get pretty sad, looking at a flower that I know is gonna wilt in no time.”
（乙女だ……）=(So pure...)
「この前、こっそりチェックしてた鳥の巣で雛が孵ってたよ」=“The other day, this bird's nest I've been keeping a stealthy eye finally had the egg in it hatch.”
「チェックって何よ。あんた監視員？」=“Fancy yourself a watchman or something? Keeping an eye on a bird's nest like that.”
「そんな突き放したこと言っていいのかな？　すっごい可愛いのになー」=“You sure you wanna be like that? It's super adorable too~”
「……うっ」=“...Uu--”
「ちっちゃいぞー」=“It's really tiny~”
「そ、その言い草、もしかして……」=“T-The way you're talking, you don't...”
「動画あるよ。ちゃんとさっきの態度を謝ったら……」=“I do. I've got a video right here. If you apologize for your attitude from before then I might just...”
「ごめんなさい！　早くそれ見せて」=“I'm so sorry! Lemme see it already.”
（いつもそれぐらい素直ならいいのに）=(She'd be perfect if she could just be honest like that all the time.)
「知ってる？　民宿の庭のアサガオが咲いたんだよ」=“Did you know? The morning glory in the guesthouse's yard finally bloomed.”
「ふぅん、そうなのね」=“Hmm, I see.”
「あんまり興味ないのか。実は俺、こっそり水をあげたりしてたんだよね……」=“Not all that interested, huh? I've actually been watering it out of everyone's notice for a while now, you know?...”
「自分の家でもないのに？」=“Even though it's not your house?”
「そう言われるとそうなんだけど、なんだか気になって」=“I mean, it's not but, I just felt like it.”
「あんたも物好きね。それで……どうだったの？」=“You've got weird hobbies. So... how was it?”
「どうって？」=“How was it what?”
「わざわざ私に言うくらいだから綺麗だったんでしょ？」=“If you went out of your way to tell me about it then it must be very pretty, no?”
「ああ、うん。綺麗な花をつけたよ」=“Aah, yeah. It bloomed into a really pretty flower.”
「そう……じゃあ、機会があったら見ておくわ」=“I see... I'll go check it out then, when I get the chance.”
「マンタって名前はほんわかしてるけど、見た目はいかついよね」=“Manta as a name sounds pretty warm but, they're actually pretty grim looking, aren't they?”
「まあ、迫力はあるかも？　あの大きさだもの」=“Well, I guess yeah? They are pretty darn big.”
「マンタと人間が一緒に映ってる写真見て、ちょっと引いたよ」=“I saw this one photo of a person posing next to a manta, and honestly it freaked me out a bit.”
「大きいのだと、５メートルくらいのサイズだって見た気がするわ」=“I feel like I've read somewhere before that they can get as big as 5 meters.”
「2階建ての建物くらいかな？　５メートルって」=“I guess about as big as a 2 storey building? That's about 5 meters, right?”
「そう聞くと巨大ね。人が住めちゃうんだ……」=“When you say it like that, it really does sound big. People could live on one...”
「住むって背中に？」=“What, on its back?”
「海ほたるって神秘的だよね」=“Sea fireflies are very mystical, aren't they?”
「そうね。確かこの島でも見れるんでしょ？」=“Yeah. If I remember right, we can see some on this island, right?”
「だね。でも、海ほたるの正体を知ってると……」=“Yeah. But, once you find out their actual form...”
「無粋なことは言わなくていいの。目に映っている光景が綺麗なら、それで充分だわ」=“You can keep that unromantic stuff to yourself. For me, as long as they look pretty, that's good enough.”
「それもそっか」=“That's fair.”
「今度から、空気を読まないことは言わない様に気を付けなさい」=“From now on, do endeavour to not say such tactless things in front of me.”
「肝に銘じます……」=“I shall take it to heart...”
「ウミガメっていうと思い出すのは、やっぱり産卵かな」=“When you think "sea turtles", what comes to mind first is the sight of them laying eggs, isn't it?”
「そうね、涙を流しながら卵を産んでるシーンとかやっぱり連想しちゃうわ」=“Yeah, I just can't help but think of the scene of them crying while laying eggs.”
「どんな生き物も女性は大変だ……」=“No matter what sort of creature, the women always have it rough...”
「ふぅん、随分としおらしいことを言うじゃない」=“Hmmm, that's a pretty sweet thought to have.”
「俺だったらせめて、そばについててあげたいかな」=“If it were me, I'd atleast want to be there to ease the pain.”
「手でも握ってくれるの？　励ましたり」=“Gonna hold my hand? Support me emotionally?”
「……握ろうか？」=“...You want me to?”
「あんたと私って意味で言ったわけじゃないわよ！　一般論」=“I didn't mean it like that, you dummy! I was talking generally.”
「星の砂っていいネーミングだと思わない？」=“Don't you think starsand has pretty good branding?”
「上から目線……まあ、言いたいことはわかるけど」=“What's that attitude for... well, I do get what you're going for though.”
「ロマンチックな響きをしてるし……」=“It's got a real romantic ring to it too...”
「もう買った？」=“You already bought some?”
「もうって何よ。ああいうのは、自分で買うものじゃないでしょ？」=“What's that "already" for? That's not the sort of thing you buy yourself, no?”
（プレゼントしたら喜ぶかな……）=(Would it make her happy if I gifted her some then?...)
「ウムイの鐘ってどの段階で成立してるんだと思う？」=“So, when do you think the Bell of Umuy actually come into force?”
「ちょっと言ってることがわからないわ」=“I don't get what you're asking me.”
「いつ、二人で鳴らしたことになるのかなぁって。音が鳴った時？　何回鳴らすの？」=“I was just wondering, at what point does it count as having been 'rung'? The moment you hear the sound? How many times do you have to do it?”
「……あんたって意外と細かい性格なの？」=“...Are you actually like a finicky person inside?”
「間違いがあったら嫌だし」=“Well, I really wouldn't want to do it wrong.”
「なんの意気込みよ……」=“Where's all that enthusiasm coming from...”
「おっぱいに一番近い感触って、女性目線だとなんだと思う？」=“From a woman's perspective, what do you think comes closest to the texture and feel of boobs?”
「なな、何を聞いてるのよ！　あんた、気は確か？」=“W-W-What're you asking me?! Are you sane?”
「いたって健常だよ。それで、どうかな？」=“The very picture of health. So then, what is it?”
「どうって言われても……分からないわよ」=“Even if you ask me... I don't know.”
「触ってみれば俺も同じ目線で悩めるようになると思うんだけど」=“I do think I'd be able to consider the problem from the same perspective if I got to feel some up.”
「この流れで触ってきたら叩くからね？」=“If you go for them over a reason like that I'm gonna smack you, you know?”
「フェチも色々あるけど、引くようなものってある？」=“There's all sorts of fetishes out there but, do you think there's any particularly gross ones?”
「山ほどあるでしょ。ほら……いじめるのが好きとか？」=“Tons and tons, no? Like... liking bullying others or whatever?”
「あれ、そういうタイプじゃないの？」=“Huh, you don't?”
「当たり前でしょ！　私はあんたと違って普通なの」=“Of course I don't! Unlike you, I'm normal.”
「ん？　俺は何フェチだと思われてるの？」=“Nn? Just what sort of fetish do you even think I have?”
「わ、わかんないけど、とにかくエッチよ！」=“I-I dunno but, you're just lewd, end of story!”
「それは男なら誰でもそうです」=“That's just all men, miss.”
「欲求不満にさせない様に、俺は頑張るよ」=“I'll do my best, so that you never have to feel sexually frustrated.”
「ななな、何の決意表明よ！？」=“W-W-W-What's that declaration for?!”
「どこがとは言わないけど、乾く間もないくらいに――」=“I won't say which part but, I'll make sure you don't even get the chance to dry up dow--”
「意味がわかんないことを口走ろうとしないで！」=“Don't just blurt out stuff that doesn't make any sense!”
「……俺が何を言おうとしたか分かったから、遮ったんじゃないの？」=“...Didn't you stop me midway precisely because you knew exactly where I was going?”
「エッチ！　バカ！　スケベ！」=“You perv! Dummy! Lecher!”
「その……俺と初めてした時のこと、覚えてる？」=“Uhm... you remember the first time we did it together?”
「きゅ、急に何を言い出すわけ！？」=“W-What're you even saying so out of the blue!?”
「ああ、いや……変な意味じゃなくてさ……痛くなかったかなとか思ったりして……」=“Aah, well... I didn't mean anything weird... I was just wondering if it hurt at all...”
「そ、そういうことね……」=“A-Ah, I see...”
「まぁ、痛かったけど、それ以上に……」=“Well, it did hurt but, more than that, it felt...”
「それ以上に？」=“It felt?”
「何でもない！　何でもないわ！」=“Nothing! It's nothing!”
「えぇっ！？　気になるんだけど……」=“Eeh--!? But you've got me curious now...”
「そんなこと聞くなんて、デリカシーがないわよ！」=“I can't believe you'd ask me something like that, you're so insensitive!”
