「とりあえず、色んなレジャーを楽しもうよ」=“For now, let's just enjoy ourselves here. There's so many things to do.”
「そうだな。どれがいいか、一緒に考えようぜ」=“Yeah. Let's go over them together, and figure out the best ones.”
「アクティビティがいっぱいあるから、どれにしようか迷っちゃうよ」=“There's lots of activities so, it's easy to get lose yourself over which to do, isn't it?”
「迷うくらいなら、全部やっちまえばいいじゃねぇか」=“If it's to that point, then just start knocking them off one by one.”
「やっぱり暑いから、涼しくなれるアクティビティがいいかな」=“It really is so hot, I guess activities that let you cool down would be the best?”
「軟弱な事言ってんじゃねぇよ。南の島なんだから暑いに決まってんだろ？」=“Don't be so weak. It's a southern island, did you think it was gonna snow or something?”
「景色も綺麗だし、歩いてるだけでレジャー気分だね」=“The scenery's just so beautiful too, just taking a walk feels like an activity in itself, doesn't it?”
「そうだな。この島自体がテーマパークみたいな気分だぜ」=“Yeah. This island feels like a whole ass theme park.”
「どんなアクティビティが好きなの？」=“What sort of activities do you like?”
「そうだなぁ、スリルのある、気合の入ったヤツがいいかな」=“Good question~, thrilling stuff, that lets you get into it easily, I guess.”
「アクティビティで怪我しないように気を付けないとね」=“We're gonna have to be careful to not injure ourselves while having fun, won't we?”
「大丈夫だよ。ちょっとやそっとの怪我ぐらい、気にする事ないぜ」=“It'll be fine. A little scratch here and there won't kill you.”
「自然が豊かな場所って、何となく神聖な感じがするよね」=“Nature rich places like these, kinda feel holy somehow, don't they?”
「確かに、人間が勝手に荒らしちゃダメだって気はするな」=“For sure, almost makes you feel like as humans, we're being told to not make a mess of it.”
「自然に囲まれていると、なんだか心が穏やかになるよね」=“Being surrounded by nature on all sides like this makes your heart really relax, doesn't it?”
「まぁ、言われてみればイライラしねぇし、そういう事なのかもな」=“Well, now that you say it, I don't really feel all that pissed, so it might.”
「都会と違って、本当に空気が綺麗で美味しいよね」=“Unlike the city, the air here really is clean and delicious, isn't it?”
「排ガスとか、そういうのとは無縁だろうからな……綺麗なはずだぜ」=“Probably because there's no exhaust gas or anything here... so of course it's clean.”
「自然が多いって事は、不便な面もあるんだろうな」=“With so much nature here, there's probably a lot of inconvenient things too, huh?”
「そんなの気合で何とかなるだろ？　人間だって自然の一部なんだからな」=“That's just stuff you can power through, no? Humans are part of nature, you know.”
「この島特有の植物とか、動物がいっぱいいるんだろうな」=“Bet there's a whole lot of plants and animals here that you won't find elsewhere.”
「そんなのがいるなら見てみたいな。どんだけ変わってるんだろうな」=“I'd love to see those if I can. I wonder how different they are compared to the stuff back home.”
「ここは暖かいから、色んな昆虫がいそうだね」=“With how warm it is here, feels like there'd also be all sorts of insects, doesn't it?”
「お前、虫好きなのか？　まぁ、私も綺麗なヤツなら見てみたいかな」=“What, you like bugs or something? Well, I wanna see the pretty ones too, I guess.”
「ここは本当に海が綺麗だよね」=“The sea really is clean and beautiful, isn't it?”
「あぁ、最高に綺麗だな……ずっと見てたって飽きないくらいだぜ」=“Yeah, it really is... so beautiful you'd never get tired of looking at it.”
「やっぱり水平線に沈む夕日ってロマンチックだよね」=“The sun going down beyond the horizon really is a romantic sight, isn't it?”
「それなら、朝日だってカッコいいぜ。なんか、やってやるぜって気分になるからな」=“Dawn's pretty cool too, you know. It kinda, fills me up with the drive to take on the world.”
「海の生き物って何が好き？」=“Which sea animal do you like the most?”
「動物としてか？　それとも、食べ物としてか？」=“You mean as an animal? Or as food?”
「綺麗な海で泳げるなんて、幸せだよね」=“I can't believe we get to swim in such a pretty sea, it's just bliss, isn't it?”
「海が綺麗だと、海水のしょっぱさも違うんじゃないかって気がするぜ」=“When it's this pretty and clean, even the saltiness of the water feels a bit different.”
「この島の海は、本当に穏やかだよね」=“The sea here really is calm, isn't it?”
「そうだな。私の知ってる海は、もっと荒波がざっぱーんって感じだからな」=“Yeah. All the seas I know are very rowdy and wavey.”
「海で遊ぶとしたら何がいいかな？」=“What do you think would be fun to do out on the sea?”
「私、銛で魚突いてみたいぜ。そんで、浜辺で焼いて食うんだ」=“I wanna try catching fish with a harpoon, personally. And then, cook up those fish out on the beach and eat 'em.”
「この島の名物って言ったらなんだろうね？」=“If you had to pick out the one local speciality, what'd it be?”
「島の人間に聞けば一発でわかるんじゃねぇの。それとも、いっぱいあって逆に決められないとか？」=“Wouldn't asking the locals get you the answer in one go? Or are there's so many that even they can't pick one out?”
「名物に旨いものなしってよく聞くけど、この島はどうなんだろう」=“They say that "famous doesn't mean it tastes good" but, what about stuff from this island?”
「そりゃ、昔の話だろ？　今は真空パックとかされてるから、結構旨いものが多いらしいぜ」=“That's from back in the day, no? Nowadays it's even vacuum packed and whatnot, so I'm pretty sure most of it should taste good.”
「この島の民芸品にも、何か伝承があるのかな」=“You think there's any sorts of legends, behind the local handicrafts?”
「そりゃあるんじゃないか。福をまねくとか、長生きするとかよく聞くからな」=“Probably, no? I mean you hear about many of them bringing happiness, or granting a long life or whatever else.”
「この島の自販機、見たことない飲み物とか売ってるよね」=“The vending machines on this island sell a whole lot of stuff that you'd never find back in the city, don't they?”
「やたら安かったりするんだよな。イマイチ買う度胸がねぇけど」=“It tends to be ridiculously cheap too, doesn't it? I don't have the balls to try any myself though.”
「これだけ暖かい気候だと、果物もいっぱいとれるんだろうね」=“With a climate this warm, I bet they're able to farm lots of fruit here too.”
「やっぱ南国だからな。マンゴーとかパイナップルとかいっぱいとれるんじゃないか」=“That's the southern country for you. They probably harvest a whole lotta mangoes or pineapple, no?”
「サトウキビをよく見かけるから、やっぱりその加工品が多いんだろうね」=“You see sugarcane all over the place here, they probably process into a whole lot of stuff, I bet.”
「サトウキビの加工品って言ったら砂糖だよな。後何があるんだ？　お菓子とかか？」=“I mean, processed sugarcane is just sugar, no? What else can you make out of it? Sweets?”
「エッチの時って何に集中してる？」=“What do you focus on when we have sex?”
「お前、何聞いてんだよ。まぁ、目の前の事に集中してるに決まってるだろ」=“What are you even asking me? But well, the answer's obviously that I focus on the guy in front of me.”
「一人でムラムラしたら、オナニーとかするの？」=“Do you masturbate, when you feel horny by yourself?”
「そりゃ、私一人だけなら……てか、変な事聞くなよ」=“I mean, if I'm alone then... heck, don't ask me weird stuff.”
「本物のおちんちんと玩具、どっちがいい？」=“Between a dildo and the real thing, which do you prefer?”
「お前なぁ……本物だよ、玩具じゃイマイチもりあがらねぇからな」=“You... the real thing, dumbass. A dildo doesn't really get me going.”
「あのな……そんなの答えられるわけねぇだろ」=“You know... do ya really think I can answer that?”
「ダメだ……お前には教えてやらねぇよ」=“No way... I ain't tellin' you.”
