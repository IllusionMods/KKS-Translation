「ホエールウォッチングに興味ある？」=“Got any interest in whale watching?”
「うん！　クジラやイルカに会えるんでしょ。すっごく面白そう」=“Yep! We'd get to see a whale or dolphins, no? That sounds real fun.”
「クジラに会えたら何がしたい？」=“What would you do if you saw a whale though?”
「餌やりかな？　お魚をたくさんあげてクジラをお腹いっぱいにしてあげるの」=“I guess I'd feed it? I'd feed it lots of fish and make its belly all full and happy.”
「そうしたらきっとお礼の潮吹きを見せてくれるはずだよ」=“I bet it'd spout some water for you as thanks if you did that.”
「あはは。それなら餌と一緒に雨合羽も用意しないとね」=“Ahahah. I'm gonna have to prepare a raincoat too, along with all the feed then.”
「ヤシガニって知ってる？　ヤシの実を食べるヤドカリのことなんだけど」=“Do you know about coconut crabs? Those hermit crabs that feed on coconuts.”
「うん、知ってるよぉ。すごく大きなハサミを持ってるんだよね」=“Yep, I do~. They've got real big pincers, don't they?”
「あれだけ立派なハサミなら、たぶん石も砕けるだろうね」=“With pincers that big, I imagine they could probably crush rocks too.”
「わぁ、それならきっと世界最強だよぉ」=“Wah~, that'd make them the strongest in the whole world~”
「え？　どうして？」=“Eh? Why?”
「だって、チョキでグーに勝てるならじゃんけんで負けなしだもん」=“Well, they could just crush the rock with their scissors, there's no way for them to lose at rock paper scissors that way.”
「じゃんけんが自然界で通用することを祈ろう……」=“Well. let's hope that rock paper scissors is popular in the jungle of nature then...”
「月桃って知ってる？」=“Do you know what shell gingers are?”
「ゲットウ……？　聞いたことないけど、果物なのかなぁ？」=“Shell gingers...? I've never heard of them, are they a fruit or something?”
「月桃は島に自生しているハーブのことだよ。ショウガの仲間で独特の香りがするんだ」=“It's a herb that grows natively on this island. It's in the same family as gingers so it's got a real unique scent to it.”
「葉から抽出したエキスには防虫効果があってね、アロマオイルにも使われてるみたい」=“Extract from it is pretty darn useful as insect repellent too so, seems like it's also made into aroma oil.”
「へぇ～、そうなんだぁ。すご～い。物知りだねぇ」=“Heh~, I see~. Amazing~, you really know your stuff~”
「これからもいろいろと教えてね。あなたとのお喋り、すごくタメになるよぉ」=“Teach me lots more stuff, okay? I'm sure talking more with you's gonna be real helpful for me in the future~”
（無垢な瞳が眩しい！　ついさっきネットで調べたなんて言えない……）=(Those eyes, they're too bright and pure! I can't tell her that I just looked that up on the internet...)
「ヤマネコって知ってる？　島にいる野生の猫のことなんだけど」=“You know what wildcats are? I'm talking about the rough and wild looking cats on the island.”
「猫ってみんな野生じゃないの？　よくお外をお散歩してるよ」=“Aren't all cats wild? You see a whole lot of them outside.”
「家で飼われてる猫もいるでしょ。その子たちはイエネコと呼ばれてるんだ」=“I mean, there's pet cats too, no? All of those ones are called housecats.”
「それで、初めから野生で暮らす猫をヤマネコと呼ぶんだよ」=“The ones that grow up in the wild from the start are called wildcats.”
「へぇ～、そうなんだぁ」=“Heh~, I see~”
「じゃあじゃあ、都会にいても人に飼われてない野良猫はみんなヤマネコなの？」=“Then then, even the city cats that roam the alleys and whatnot and don't really like being around humans, are they wildcats too?”
「え！？　そ、それはどうだろう。都会の野良はただのノラネコのような気がする……」=“Eh!? I-I, hmm, I don't know. I feel like they're just regular old straycats...”
「そんなのおかしいよ。野生のネコをヤマネコと呼ぶなら野良猫もヤマネコの仲間だよ」=“That's just weird. If cats found in the wild are wildcats then stray cats should be those same kind.”
「野良猫だけ仲間はずれにしないで。可哀想だよぉ」=“Don't exclude the stray cats from that too. That's just mean~”
「わ、わかったよ。それじゃあ野良猫もヤマネコの仲間……ということにしておこう」=“I-I got it. Let's just call them all wildcats then... is that okay?”
「流れ星に願い事をするなら、何てお願いする？」=“If you got to wish upon a shooting star, what would you wish for?”
「う～ん、そうだなぁ。お菓子がたくさん降ってくるようにお願いするかなぁ」=“Nn~, let's see~. Maybe for lots of sweets to fall from the sky~”
「わざわざお菓子の雨を降らせるの？」=“What, gonna ask for a rain of sweets?”
「うん。そうしたらみんなにもお菓子をお裾分けできるでしょ」=“Yep. That way not just me, but everyone would be able to have some sweets, no?”
「みんなのことも考えてたのか。優しいね」=“So you were thinking of everyone else, huh? That's pretty sweet.”
「えへへ。褒められちゃったぁ」=“Eheheh. I got complimented~”
「サガリバナって知ってる？」=“You know what mango pines are?”
「ん～？　聞いたことないなぁ。教えて教えて」=“Nn~? Never heard of them~. Tell me more, tell me more.”
「サガリバナはたったの一晩だけ花を咲かせて散る、珍しい花なんだ」=“They're flowers that bloom only for a single night, and then wilt by morning.”
「咲いている姿が花火のように見えるから、観賞用としても人気なんだよ」=“The sight of them blooming almost looks like fireworks too, so they're pretty popular in that sense.”
「わぁ～、花火のように咲くお花かぁ。夏にぴったりだね」=“Wah~, flowers that bloom like fireworks, huh~? That's so perfect for summer.”
「花言葉は『幸福が訪れる』。花が咲くところを見られたらラッキーって意味だろうね」=“In flower language, they mean "Luck will come". I imagine it means that seeing them in bloom brings good luck.”
「すご～い。花言葉まで素敵だなんて。サガリバナかぁ。咲くところ一度見てみたいなぁ」=“Amazing~. I can't believe even the flower language meaning is so lovely. Mango pines, huh~? I wanna see them blooming once~”
「実はずっと鳥の巣を見守ってたんだ。ようやく雛が孵ってホッとしたよ」=“I've actually been watching over this one nest for the longest time. And the egg within finally hatched, thank god.”
「わぁ～、すご～い。大変だったでしょ。よく続けられたね」=“Wah~, amazing~. I bet it must have been hard. I'm surprised you managed to keep watch over it.”
「庇護欲っていうのかな。卵を見守ってるうちに愛着が湧いてきてね。だから頑張れたんだ」=“Wonder if it was my protective instincts? Before I knew it, I started getting attached to it so, it was pretty easy to keep going.”
「あなたってパパの素質があるのかも。それともお兄ちゃんかな？」=“You might have the makings of a great papa. Or maybe an elder brother?”
「あはは。できればお兄ちゃんの方がいいかな」=“Ahahah. I'd prefer to be an elder brother for sure.”
「私もあなたにお世話してほしいなぁ。小鳥のマネをすれば甘えさせてくれるかな？」=“I'd love to be taken care of by you too. If I pretended to be a little birdie, would you spoil me?”
「ぴよぴよ。餌ちょうだ～い」=“Tweet tweet. Food please~”
「おっと、ずいぶんと可愛い雛鳥だ。これはお世話のし甲斐がありそうだ」=“Woah, what a cute chick. Very worth taking care of, for sure.”
「宿の庭先にアサガオが咲いてるのを見たことある？　あの花、俺が育てたんだよ」=“Have you seen the morning glories growing in the garden next to the inn? I was the one watering them this whole time.”
「へぇ～、そうだったんだぁ。でも、どうしてアサガオの面倒を見ようと思ったの？」=“Heh~, so it was you, huh? But, what made you do that? Why'd you go out of your way to water them this whole time?”
「何となくかな。一度水をあげたら、最後までやり遂げなきゃと思うようになったんだ」=“I just did, I guess. I watered them once and just felt like I had to water them till they bloomed.”
「責任感が強いんだね。すごく素敵♪」=“You've got a real sense of responsibility, huh? That's so lovely♪”
「お花を愛でる男って気持ち悪くない？」=“Doesn't a man so into flowers come off as a bit disgusting though?”
「そんなことないよぉ。お花にも優しくできる男の人って心が澄んでると思うもん」=“Not at all~. I think a man who can be so nice to flowers would have to have a clear heart.”
「そ、そうかな。照れちゃうな。あはは」=“Y-You think? Man, I'm gonna blush. Ahahah.”
「マンタって知ってる？　エイの仲間なんだけど」=“You know what Mantas are? They're a kind of ray.”
「エイ？　エイってどんなお魚だっけ。サメの仲間？」=“Ray? What sort of fish was a ray again? A kind of shark?”
「そこからか……。あれ？　でも、エイとサメの違いってなんだ？」=“We gotta start from there, huh... But wait, huh? What would be the difference between a shark and a ray?”
「エイもサメも肌が青白くてヌメヌメしてるでしょ？　だからきっと仲間だよ」=“Both rays and sharks have bluish white slimey skin, no? So I bet you they're from the same family.”
「そう言われると似てるような。専門知識がないから違いを説明できない！」=“I mean, when you say it like that, I almost feel convinced. I am not even remotely an expert so I can't explain the difference at all!”
「ところでマンタって知ってる？　エイの仲間なんだって」=“By the way, do you know about Mantas? Apparently it's a kind of a ray.”
「ごめんなさい。マンタのこともエイのことも、詳しく存じあげませんでした……」=“I apologize. I knew naught of what I spoke, neither about mantas nor about rays...”
「海ほたるはどうして青く光るか知ってる？」=“You know why sea fireflies glow blue?”
「えー？　よくわかんなぁい。もしかして電球を飲み込んでるの？」=“Eh~? I dunno~. Do they have LEDs inside them?”
「あはは。だったら面白いけど、正解は酸素と反応する特殊な成分を分泌することで……」=“Ahahah. That'd be pretty interesting in its own way but, the actual answer is that they secrete this special chemical that reacts with oxygen and...”
「すやすや……」=“Zzzz...”
「あれ！？　突然眠り始めた！？」=“Huh?! So suddenly!?”
「難しくて眠くなっちゃった。理由はともかく、海ほたるは綺麗なんだからそれでいいよぉ」=“It was so difficult my brain just couldn't. I don't care about the reason, they glow really pretty so that's just fine.”
「あはは。あまり興味なかったみたいだね……」=“Ahahah. Seems like I didn't manage to catch your interest, huh...”
「ウミガメって思ってたより大きいよね」=“Sea turtles are bigger than you'd ever expect, aren't they?”
「うんうん。あれだけ大きければ甲羅に乗っても平気そうだよね」=“Yepyep. With how big they are, bet they'd be just fine even with a person riding on top.”
「あはは……実際に乗ったら各方面から怒られそうだけど、一度は考えるかな」=“Ahahah... you'd probably anger one a whole ton if you actually tried but, I can kinda see it, maybe.”
「ウミガメに乗って竜宮城へれっつごー！　玉手箱はあなたにあげるね」=“Let's get on one and go to the Palace of the Dragon King! I'll let you have the tamatebako.”
「え？　貰っちゃっていいの？」=“Eh? You sure about that?”
「うん。だってお婆ちゃんになりたくないもん」=“Yep. I don't wanna become a granny, afterall.”
「ナチュラルに面倒事を押しつけられた……」=“Not even a spare thought before shoving the bothersome thing to me...”
「星の砂って綺麗だよね」=“Starsand is really pretty, isn't it?”
「うんうん。砂がお星様の形をしてるなんて素敵だよねぇ」=“Yepyep. It's amazing how sand can take the shape of a star, isn't it~?”
「ねえ、知ってる？　星の砂が詰まった小瓶を傾けると波の音が聞こえるんだよ」=“Hey, did you know? If you take a bottle filled with starsand and tilt it on its side, you can hear the sound of waves.”
「ああ、確かに。砂の流れる音と波の音ってよく似てるからね」=“Aah, for sure. Probably because the sound of sand falling and the sound of waves is pretty similar.”
「目で見ても、耳で聴いても思い出が蘇る星の砂……まさに夏の結晶だね」=“Sand that makes your memories clear all over again, just from looks alone and the sound alone too... truly a crystalization of summer, isn't it?”
「ウムイの鐘を鳴らすと恋が実るというけど本当かな？」=“They say that ringing the Bell of Umuy makes your love bear fruit, but is that really true?”
「え？　本当もなにもそういう言い伝えでしょ？」=“Eh? I mean, that's why it's a legend, no?”
「いや。言い伝えだからって１００パーセント事実ってわけでもないから」=“No. Just because it's legend doesn't mean it's 100% true, you know.”
「え～？　じゃあじゃあ、どうしてみんな鐘を鳴らすの？」=“Eh~? Then then, why does everyone go and ring it?”
「それはまあ……恋が実りますようにって、願掛けみたいな感じで鳴らすんじゃないかな」=“That's, well... Don't they do it as a sort of prayer, wishing for their love to bear fruit?”
「だったら嘘か本当かなんて関係ないよ。信じるか信じないか、だから」=“In that case whether it's true or not doesn't matter. It's more about whether you believe in it or not.”
「言われてみれば確かに。疑うだけ野暮ってことだね」=“When you put it like that, I get it. Even doubting it is just tasteless, isn't it?”
「きみの胸って……」=“Your chest...”
「私のお胸をジロジロ見てどうしたの？　興味あるの？」=“What's got you staring at it? Interested in it?”
「興味がないと言えば嘘になるかな」=“It'd be a lie to say that I'm not, for sure.”
「そうなんだ。ふふっ、じゃあ見ていいよ」=“I see. Fufuh, then feel free to look if you want.”
「えっ！？　いいの？　それじゃあ遠慮無く……」=“Eh--!? You sure? I'm not gonna hold back then...”
「なんてねっ。やっぱり今のナシ。急に恥ずかしくなってきちゃった」=“Just kidding--! Cancel that one. It suddenly feels a whole lot more embarrassing.”
「ええ～。そんなぁ～」=“Eeh~. Don't say that~”
「きみって何フェチなの？」=“What's your biggest fetish?”
「んん～？　そういうのよくわからないよぉ。例えばどういうフェチがあるの？」=“Nn~? I don't know about that kinda stuff~. What sort of fetishes are even are there?”
「女の子の場合だと二の腕フェチとか、喉仏フェチとかよく聞くかな」=“Since you're a girl, stuff like a bicep fetish or, adam's apple fetish and whatnot. I've heard of those before for sure.”
「あ～、男の人の体でグッとくる場所ってことかぁ。それならやっぱりアソコかなぁ」=“Ah~, you mean the sort of places on a man's body that just send twitches through me, huh~? In my case it'd be that part, you know~?”
「えっ！？　アソコってまさか……」=“Eh--?! You don't mean...”
「あっ！　違う違うのっ。エッチな意味じゃなくて、部位の名前を忘れちゃっただけだよぉ」=“Ah--! No, no--! I didn't mean it like that, I just can't remember the name of the part itself~”
「エッチな気分になった時はどうしてるの？」=“What do you do when you get into a lewd mood?”
「えっ？　どうしてそういうこと訊くの？」=“Eh--? Why're you asking me that?”
「興味本位だよ。できれば教えてほしいな」=“Just curiosity, really. I'd love to hear it.”
「じゃあ、あなたの話を聞かせて。男の人ってエッチな気分になったらどうしてるの？」=“Tell me about yourself first then. What do men do when they get into a lewd mood?”
「えっ！？　そ、それは……どうしてそんなこと訊くの？」=“Eh--?! T-That's... why're you asking me that?”
「あなたと同じだよ。女の子だってそういうのに興味あるんだから。ね？　教えて」=“The same reason as you. Girls are curious about that sorta stuff too. So, tell me?”
「うぅ……墓穴を掘ってしまった……」=“Uuu... I dug my own grave...”
「初めてのエッチはどうだった？」=“How was it, our first time together?”
「すっごくよかったよぉ。フワフワしちゃった」=“It was super amazing~. I felt so fluffy.”
「それはよかった。きみを怖がらせたんじゃないかと思ってたから」=“Glad to hear that. I was worried that I might have scared you a bit.”
「最初は怖かったけど、あなたが優しくしてくれたから途中で不安が消えたの」=“I was scared at first but, you were really gentle so all of that disappeared midway through.”
「えへへ……初めての人が、あなたで良かったよぉ」=“Eheheh... I'm really glad that, you were my first~”
