「ホエールウォッチングって一度くらい挑戦してみたいよね」=“You just can't help but wanna have a go at whale watching atleast once, can you?”
「挑戦というが、乗り越えるべき困難などあるかのう？」=“You say it like there's something to be conquered there.”
「どちらかというと運かな」=“Well, you definitely need luck on your side for sure.”
「ふむ、わしは運要素は好かぬ。喜びとは困難の先にあるべきなのじゃ」=“Hmm, I do not like luck in things. Happiness ought to follow hardship instead.”
「なら、頑張って運要素を排除するとか……」=“In that case, we'll have to do our best and replace the luck with something else...”
「餌でも撒くのじゃ？」=“Going to scatter feed for it?”
「ヤシガニってなんでも食べるらしいよ」=“Seems like coconut crabs can eat just about anything.”
「あのハサミを知っておると、いっそう不安をそそられる情報じゃのう……」=“That's even more worrying, knowing how powerful those claws of theirs are...”
「性格も獰猛らしいし」=“Seems like they're pretty ferocious too.”
「それは初耳なのじゃ！？　やつめ、獰猛なのか……」=“That's the first I've heard of that though!? Ferocious, huh...”
（いや、適当に言ったけど……）=(No, well, I just said whatever came out of my mouth honestly...)
「不安になってきたのじゃ。鉢合わせしたらどうするのじゃ……」=“Now I'm worried. What if I run into one...”
「餌になりそうなものでも持ち歩くとか？」=“Maybe you could carry some sort of feed to placate it?”
「月桃ってキレイだよね」=“Shell gingers are really pretty, aren't they?”
「ふむ、あの花か。月桃に限らず大抵の花はキレイだと思うのじゃ」=“Hmm, you mean those flowers? I do think most flowers are quite pretty, not just them.”
「花が好きなんだ？」=“You like flowers?”
「心が癒やされるからのう。それに香りもよいのじゃ」=“They are very soothing to me, that's for certain. And their scent as well.”
「月桃は好き嫌いありそうな匂いだけど」=“Shell gingers have a very "you either like it or hate it" scent though.”
「落ち着くじゃろう？　嗅いでいると、ふーって気分になるのじゃ」=“It is very calming, no? Smelling it just clears up my mind.”
「ヤマネコは絶滅の危機に瀕してるらしいよ」=“Seems like wildcats are a species on the verge of extinction.”
「……諸行無常、じゃの」=“...All things must pass, eventually.”
「人間の時代にならなければ、そんなことにならなかったのかもとは思うよね」=“It does make you think though, doesn't it? If it wasn't for us humans, that might not have happened.”
「強者が世の定めを決めるという意味では、やむをえぬのじゃろうが……」=“It is unavoidable, in the sense that the strong decide the fate of the world...”
「小さな命に罪はないからのう」=“Such small life has no sin of its own.”
「俺達に何かできることってあるかな？」=“You think there's anything we can do?”
「寄付じゃな」=“Donate money, I suppose.”
「ぐうの音も出ない正論だね……」=“That's so reasonable I have no words...”
「流れ星っていったら、やっぱり星に願うことかな」=“I guess the first thing that comes to mind when you think "shooting star" is making a wish?”
「一般的にはそうかもしれぬ。じゃが、わしは星に祈ったことなどないぞ」=“For most, perhaps. However, I have never done such a thing myself.”
「そうなの？」=“Really?”
「神頼みというのはあまり好まぬからな」=“I do not have much of a positive opinion of relying on the gods and such.”
「願いとは自分で叶えるものじゃ」=“Wishes are something you make come true yourself.”
「おお、恰好いい……」=“Ooh, so cool...”
「それに……あまりこういうことを言いたくないのじゃが、流れ星の正体を知っておると……な」=“Not to mention... I do not like saying such unromantic things, however, once you know what shooting stars actually are... you know?”
「まあ、それは確かに……」=“Well, you're not wrong...”
「サガリバナの花って、ふわふわして綿みたいだよね」=“Mango pines are so soft and fluffy, just like cotton bolls, aren't they?”
「実際に見たことはないが、言いたいことはわかるのじゃ」=“I've never seen one myself but, I understand what you're trying to get at.”
「ちょっと、たんぽぽみたいな」=“They're kinda like, dandelions.”
「まあ、綿毛に似ていると言われたらそうかもしれぬな」=“Well, you wouldn't find me disagreeing if you say that it looks similar to dandelion fluff, certainly.”
「綿毛と違って、風の代わりに川に運ばれていくらしいね」=“But unlike them, it seems like they're carried away by the water instead of the wind.”
「わしも映像で見たぞ。あれは雅じゃのう。是非、一度はこの目て見たところじゃが……」=“I have seen that before as well, on the television. I definitely would like to see it with my own eyes someday...”
「一夜しか咲かない花だしね……狙って見にいくのは難しいかも」=“They're flowers that only bloom for a single night though, sadly... it might be pretty difficult to actually hunt some down to look at them.”
「この前、たまに見に行ってた鳥の巣で雛が孵ってたよ」=“The other day, this bird's nest I've been checking over for a while now finally had the eggs in it hatch.”
「命の摂理じゃの」=“The cycle of life and death, huh?”
「そんな返しがくるとは思わなかった……」=“I didn't think that's what you'd start with...”
「卵が孵り、雛はやがて成長し、成長を見届けた親鳥はやがて土に返る……」=“The egg hatching, the chick maturing, the parent of the grown bird returning to the Earth...”
「普通に摂理じゃろう」=“If that's not the cycle of life and death then what is it?”
「そう言うならそうだけどさ。もっとこう、可愛いー……とか」=“I mean, it is but, I was expecting more like "so cute~"... and whatnot.”
「……確かに、普通は真っ先にそういうことを言うべきじゃな」=“...Certainly, I suppose that's what someone should go with first.”
「どんな感じなのじゃ？　写真とかあるのかのう？」=“What is it like? Did you take a picture, perhaps?”
「あはは……後で見せてあげるね」=“Ahahah... I'll show it to you later.”
「民宿の庭でアサガオが咲いてたの知ってる？　あれ俺が水やってたんだよ」=“You know that morning glory growing in the yard at the boarding house? I'm the one who's been watering that.”
「アサガオなんて、あったかのう？」=“Was there a morning glory there?”
「……そっか、あんまり目がいかないかー」=“...I see, it's not very noticeable, huh?”
「すまん……これからは注意するから、そうしょげるでない」=“Apologies... I shall pay more attention to it from now on so, do not look so dejected.”
「誰も見てないかも知れぬのに関わらず、ずっと世話をしたお主の努力は素晴らしいと思うぞ」=“I think it's a wonderful thing you've done though, especially since nobody might have ever noticed.”
「努力ってのは大げさだよ。実際はただ水をあげてただけだし」=“It's not that big a deal. I was only just watering it, after all.”
「そんなことはないぞ。良い子良い子してあげるのじゃ」=“Not at all. Come, I shall stroke your head.”
「ふ、普通に照れくさいんだけど……」=“T-That's way too embarrassing, so stop...”
「マンタってマントだからマンタなんだよ」=“Mantas are called mantas because of mantles.”
「お主は何を言っておるのじゃ？」=“I'm sorry, what are you saying?”
「名前の由来。マントみたいだから、マンタって呼ぶようになったんだって」=“The reason behing the name "manta". It looks like a mantle so, that's why they're called mantas.”
「そういうことか。確かにそういう風に見えるかもしれぬな」=“I see. I suppose it's not impossible for someone to see it that way.”
「あと、マンタって普通にエイの一種らしいよ」=“Also, seems like they're a kind of ray too, a regular ray.”
「エイの仲間ではなくエイそのものなのか……ややこしい名前をしておるのう」=“So they're not just from the same family, but rather one of them, huh... what a tangle of a name.”
「海ほたるって飼育とかできるのかな」=“I wonder if you can breed and raise sea fireflies as pets.”
「これ、野暮なことを言うでない」=“Stop it, do not say such boorish things.”
「俺達が知らないだけで、意外ともう飼ってる人とか普通にいそうじゃない？」=“You never know, there could be people out there who already keep some as pets, no?”
「……むぅ、いないと断言はできぬのう」=“...Muh, I cannot deny it, no.”
「魚とか飼うのを趣味にしてる人いっぱいいるんだし」=“Especially since it seems like there's a lot of people who love keeping fish as pets.”
「わしは否定派じゃが、それも人という種の業か……」=“I personally very much don't see the appeal, but I suppose people are all different...”
「ウミガメって乗りたくなるよね」=“Man, seeing a sea turtle really makes you wanna ride one, doesn't it?”
「お主はたまに突拍子もないことを言い出すのう」=“You say some really crazy things sometimes.”
「もし乗れるとしたら、乗ってみたくない？」=“If you could ride one, wouldn't you want to?”
「憧れる気持ちはわかんでもないが……普通にカメがかわいそうじゃろ」=“Not that I do not understand the appeal... but I would simply feel bad for the turtle.”
「ファンタジーな妄想なんだから、現実を持ち出さないでよ」=“It's a fantasy so don't bring the nitty gritties of reality into it.”
「す、すまん……って、今のはわしが悪いのか？」=“A-Apologies... wuh, that's my fault, is it?”
「うん。だって現実を持ちだしたら、そもそも人が海の中で息できる訳ないし」=“Yeah. Afterall, it's not like people can breathe underwater anyway, so no point in dragging reality into it.”
「その通りじゃの。……わしの理解力が及ばなかったようじゃ」=“That's true. ...Seems that my mental capacities were not up to the task.”
「うむ、くるしゅうない」=“Umu, no matter.”
「星の砂って知ってる？」=“You know what starsand is?”
「お土産屋で見かけるあれじゃろ？　正体は皆目見当もつかぬが……」=“It's that thing they sell at the souvenir shop, no? Though I cannot grasp its true form at all...”
「一体なんなのじゃ？　隕石を砕いて売っておるのか？」=“Just what is it? Do they break up meteorites in a special way to sell them like that?”
「発想のスケールがでかいね」=“The scale of your thoughts is quite something, you know?”
「星の形をした砂……正確には生き物の殻だよ」=“Sand in the shape of stars... it's actually dead husks from creatures that once lived.”
「急にロマンがなくなってしまったのう」=“Suddenly it feels not even a shred as romantic.”
「現実なんてそんなものだよ」=“That's reality for you.”
「ウムイの鐘って恋人達に大人気らしいよ」=“Apparently the Bell of Umuy's a pretty darn popular spot with couples.”
「それはそうじゃろ。特に恋人同士で来たのなら……ふむ、どう言えばよいのか」=“Well, of course. Especially if you come to this island as a couple... hmm, how do I say this?”
「正月に神社に行って、がらんがらんしないようなものじゃろ」=“It'd be like going to the shrine for new years and not ringing that ringring.”
（本坪鈴は言って欲しかった……）=(I wish she said "bell" instead...)
「恋人の誓いを『とりあえずやっとく』ものにしてしまうのも味気ないものじゃがな」=“Condensing the vow of lovers into a "Let's keep it going like this" does feel a bit tasteless though.”
「その辺りは込める気持ち次第かなぁ」=“I think that part's more about the feelings you put into that, really.”
「おっぱい好きな男ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of men that love boobs?”
「まぁ、その……なんじゃ……男とは大体そういうものであろう？」=“Well, uhm... you know... men are more or less all like that, no?”
「あんまり見られて良い気はせんが……割り切ることは出来るぞ」=“It doesn't feel amazing to be brazenly stared at but... I can understand it and tolerate it.”
「俺はおっぱい嫌いな男だから、安心していいよ」=“Well, I for one hate boobs so, you don't need to worry about that.”
「見え透いた嘘をつくでない！」=“Do not put up such a flimsy lie!”
「なにか人に言えないフェチってあったりする？」=“Got any fetishes that you can't tell others about?”
「そ、そんな破廉恥なことはないぞ！」=“I-I have no such perverted things!”
「あったとしても、人に言えぬことをお主に打ち明けたりしないのじゃ」=“Even if I did, I would not open up about these "things I cannot tell others" to you.”
「そんな……俺たちの仲なのに」=“Eeh... but we're a couple.”
「親しき仲にも礼儀ありじゃぞ」=“And I do hope we can stay that way.”
「実は俺、欲求不満なんだよね」=“I'm actually pretty sexually frustrated, you know?”
「何事も素直に打ち明ければよいというわけではないぞ！？」=“You can't just say everything you ever want to out loud like that, alright?!”
「どうやって解消したらいいと思う？」=“How do you think I should go about taking care of it?”
「わ、わしの口から言わせる気なのじゃ！？　絶対に言わぬぞ！」=“I-Is that your intent, to make me say it?! I shan't!”
「そこをどうにか……！」=“Please, find it within your heart...!”
「頼み込んでも駄目なものは駄目なのじゃ！」=“Even if you beg me, some things I simply shall not do!”
「その……俺と初めてした時のこと、覚えてる？」=“Uhm... do you remember it, the first time we did it?”
「のじゃっ！？　急に何を言い出すのじゃ、お主！」=“Wha--?! What are you even saying, so randomly?!”
「ふと思って……いい思い出になったかな？」=“It just came to mind... did it make for a good memory for you?”
「……言ったかもしれぬが、わしはお主が相手でよかったと思っておるぞ……？」=“...I am fairly sure I have told you this already, but I am quite glad that you are my man, you know...?”
「ならよかった。ちなみに……俺、下手じゃなかったかな？　男の沽券に関わる問題なんだけど……」=“Great then. Incidentally... I wasn't bad, was I? It's a matter of pride for men...”
「わしには上手い、下手は分からぬが……少なくとも、気持ちは伝わってきたのじゃ」=“I have no scale for "good" or "bad" but... if nothing else, I could feel your heart.”
「気持ち？」=“My heart?”
「その、なんじゃ……わしを大切に思ってくれてる気持ちじゃ」=“It's, uhm... I could feel the fact that you truly do treasure me.”
「だから……心配しなくてよいぞ。わしにとっては良い思い出じゃからな」=“So... you needn't worry. For me, it is a good memory.”
