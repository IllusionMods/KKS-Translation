「この辺りはホエールウォッチングができるんだって」=“Apparently you can do whale watching around here.”
「へー、クジラはいいよな！　でっかいし」=“Hoh, whales are pretty nice, aren't they! They're so big.”
「やっぱり？　好きそうだと思った。一緒に見られるといいね」=“You really think so, huh? I had a hunch. It'd be nice if we could go and see one together.”
「そ、そうだな、記念になるし……」=“Y-Yeah, would be pretty memorable...”
「よし見よう。それで、クジラどこにいるんだ！」=“Alright, let's do it. Let's go find ourselves a whale!”
「船に乗って海に出なきゃいけないし、今は季節じゃないみたいだよ」=“Not only would that require us to find and rent a boat, I don't think it's whale watching season just yet.”
「この前、ヤシガニを見つけたよ」=“I saw a coconut crab the other day.”
「ヤシガニ？　ああ、あのヤドカリのでっかいやつか」=“A coconut crab? Ah, one of those bigger hermit crab things, huh?”
「身も蓋もない言い方をすれば、そうかな」=“I mean I guess that's one way of looking at them.”
「……ヤシガニってヤシの実食うんだっけ？」=“...Do they eat coconuts or something?”
「それは知らない」=“Not sure.”
「ヤシの実を背負ってる？」=“Do they carry coconuts on their back then?”
「そっちは多分、違うと思う」=“Probably not, I don't think.”
「月桃ってキレイだよね」=“Shell gingers are really pretty, aren't they?”
「ゲットー？　何それ、食物？」=“Ginger what now? Is that a thing you eat or something?”
「花だよ。この辺りでは有名なんだってさ」=“It's a flower. Apparently pretty well known around here.”
「ふーん」=“Hmmmm.”
「なんの興味もないわけね……」=“No interest at all, huh...”
「名前は美味そうなのにな」=“It sounds like it'd be real tasty from the name too.”
「結局そこに戻ってくるんだ」=“Back to food, I see.”
「そうだ。前にヤマネコ見たよ」=“Right. I saw a wildcat the other day.”
「ヤマネコはあれだな、うん……あれだ」=“Wildcats are those things, aren't they... those things.”
「強そうな猫」=“Like, a strong cat.”
「そうそう。目とか完全に肉食獣だった」=“Yeah, basically. It looked like a real carnivore, the eyes did anyway.”
「うかつに手を出したら齧られるな」=“Bet they'd bite off a piece of you if you try anything funny.”
「いや、人間を食べようとはしないんじゃ……」=“No, I don't think they really do tha...”
「知らねーの？　猫ってがぶがぶ噛むんだぞ」=“You don't know? Cats are real bitey things.”
「それ甘えてるだけ」=“That's just them showing their love.”
「この辺りでは流星群が見られるんだって。いっぱい流れ星が降ってくるやつ」=“Apparently we can see meteor showers around here. The ones where a whole lot of shooting stars go by at once.”
「マジかよ。願いごと願い放題だな」=“For real? You could wish for the world with one of those.”
「なんか安っぽくなった……」=“Suddenly they feel a whole lot cheaper...”
「しかし流れ星かぁ……」=“Still, shooting stars, huh...”
「なにかお願いしたいことでもあるの？」=“Is there something you wanna wish for?”
「はあ？　バカ、そんなの……秘密だよ」=“Haah? Idiot, that's... a secret.”
「サガリバナって神秘的だよね」=“You know those mango pine flowers? They feel really mystical, don't they?”
「サガリバナ……うーん、なんかで見たような。神秘的な……花」=“Mango pines... nnnn, I feel like I've seen one before. A mystical... flower.”
「わかった！　それ、ぴかーって光るんだろ」=“Oh, I know! They glow, don't they?”
「そこまではすごくない」=“They're not that mystical.”
「じゃあ、どんくらいすごいんだ？」=“Then, how mystical are they?”
「一晩だけ咲くんだってさ。それで、朝になつたら花を落としちゃう」=“They apparently only flower for one night. And then they wilt and fall by morning.”
「マジかよ。忙しないな……」=“For real? What're they in such a hurry for...”
（期待してた反応とは違ったな……）=(Not the sort of reaction I expected, honestly...)
「この前、ずっと気にしてた卵がようやく孵ったんだよ」=“The other day, this egg that I've been watching for a while finally hatched.”
「卵って……なんの？　亀とか？」=“Egg... of what? Like a turlte or something?”
「ちっちゃい鳥だよ。可愛くてさ」=“Actually a little bird. It's super cute.”
「旅行先で子育てかよ。お前は想像を裏切ってくるな」=“Raising a bird while out travelling, huh? You really know how to just flip someone's image of you on its head, you know.”
「見たい？」=“You wanna see it?”
「別にそこまでは……うーん」=“I mean, I wouldn't say I wanna... nnnn.”
「つれないなぁ。もしかして、鳥より私を構ってよみたいなこと？」=“So indifferent~. What, you want me to pay more attention to you than the bird?”
「誰もそんなアピールしてねーよ！」=“I did not say that, okay!?”
「ずっと世話してたアサガオが、やっと花をつけたんだよ」=“The morning glory I've been taking care of this whole time, finally started flowering.”
「へー、知らないところで自由研究みたいなことしてたんだな」=“Hoh, you were doing something like that this whole time without a peep, huh?”
「もっと興味持ってよ。この辺りのアサガオは普通のアサガオと違うんだよ。……多分」=“Sound more interested in it. The morning glories here are different from the regular kind. ...I think.”
「どう違うんだ？」=“Different how?”
「色が鮮やか？　……とか」=“The color's a lot brighter? ...And stuff.”
「全然詳しくないじゃねぇか……ま、本当に違うかもしれないし、調べてみるか」=“So you don't know... well, it really might be different, guess I'll look into it myself.”
「マンタってすごくでかいよね」=“Mantas are really big, aren't they?”
「あいつ、ちょっとした怪獣感がないか？　横に大きく拡がってて」=“Don't those kinda feel like monsters? The way they're all spread out wide and stuff.”
「でも、背中に乗ったら気持ちよさそうだな」=“But, riding one sounds real comfy, doesn't it?”
「それは何ダイビングになるの？」=“Won't that turn into diving?”
「マンタライド？　絶対、楽しぞこれ。いつかやってみたいな」=“Manta riding? Sounds super fun. I wanna do it someday.”
「難しいと思うよ……」=“Not sure it'd be that easy...”
「海ほたるの正体って、ちょっとがっかりしない？」=“Isn't it kinda disappointing finding out what sea fireflies actually are?”
「正体？　いつの間にか判明してたのかよ」=“What they are? Solved that one already, did you?”
「とっくにしてるから」=“I mean, they've already been researched plenty.”
「なんなんだ？　妖精とかかな」=“So what are they? Fairies or something?”
「そうだったらいいんだけど、甲殻類とかそういう類のものらしい」=“That'd be pretty nice but, seems like they're some sort of a crustacean.”
「カニの仲間か……でも、まあいいじゃんキレイなら」=“So basically crabs, huh... but well, that's fine, doesn't make 'em any less pretty.”
「ウミガメって７～８０年くらい生きるって知ってた？」=“Did you know that sea turtles live for 70-80 years?”
「マジで？　人間と互角だな」=“For real? That's the same as us.”
「しかも、年に何回も卵を産むこともあるんだって」=“And what's more, they lay eggs multiple times each year.”
「マジか。お母さん大忙しだな」=“For real? Being the mother sounds like a lotta work.”
「ん？　待て、その間旦那は何してるんだ？」=“Nn? Wait, and what does the father do in that time?”
「多分、見てる」=“Probably just watches.”
「あんまりだぞ！　旦那ももっと子育てを共有しろ」=“Now that's just too much! Fathers gotta help out with the kids too.”
「わ、わかった、頑張るよ」=“I-I got it, I'll help.”
「お、お前に言ったわけじゃないから！」=“I-It's not like I was saying it to you!”
「星の砂って知ってる？」=“You know what starsand is?”
「星の砂……なんだろ？　どっかで聞いたような気もしなくはない」=“Starsand... I dunno. I feel like I've definitely maybe heard of it before.”
「よく見ると星の形をしてる砂らしい」=“Apparently it's sand that looks like stars, looking up close.”
「砂の粒なんて、目を凝らしても見えねーよ」=“There's no way that's true, you can't see what a grain of sand looks like no matter how much you squint.”
「そう言われると、まあ……」=“That's, well, I mean...”
「よくわからん。それって意味あんの？」=“I don't get it. So what were you trying to get at anyway?”
「意味を聞かれたら、ないとしか言いようがないな……」=“Nothing in particular, I guess...”
「ウムイの鐘って毎年どれくらいの人に鳴らされてるんだろう」=“I wonder how many people come to ring the Bell of Umuy every year.”
「さあなあ？　観光地だし、そこそこだろ」=“Who knows? It's a tourist spot so, probably a few.”
「特にそういう関係じゃない人達も、ふざけて鳴らしてたりしそう。友達同士とか」=“I feel like people who aren't couples, like friends and whatnot, would also end up going and ringing it too, as a joke or whatever.”
「……それは天罰だな」=“...That'd call for some divine punishment.”
「厳しいね」=“That's pretty harsh.”
「神様は恋人を祝福するのに忙しいんだぞ。ふざけて邪魔したらそうなるだろ」=“Of course. God's got his hands full just blessing couples, you know? It'd be just desserts for getting in the way of that.”
（可愛いこと言い出した……）=(I didn't expect something that cute from her...)
「おっぱいって理屈じゃなく素晴らしいよね」=“Boobs are irrationally wonderful, you know?”
「なんのカミングアウトなんだ、それは」=“You coming out of some sort of closet or something?”
「男は誰でもこういうものだけど、触られる側としてはどうなの？」=“All men are like this but, what do you think of it, as the one with the boobs?”
「……ただの邪魔物だ。走ったりすると痛いし」=“...They're literally just a burden. And it hurts to run.”
「でも、触られると気持ちいいわけでしょ？　プラマイゼロじゃない」=“But, it feels good when someone touches them, right? That's like a net zero, neither bad nor good.”
「そ、それは……触り方による」=“T-That... would depend on who exactly's touching them.”
「譲れないフェチとかある？」=“Is there a fetish you just can't discard?”
「譲れなくはねーけど。なんだろ、もしかしたら、ちょっだけ……汗とか好きかも」=“I mean, it's not that serious. But let's see, I might, just... like sweat a bit.”
「汗のにおいが好きってこと？」=“You mean you like the smell of it or what?”
「そんな難しいこと言ってもわかんないけど、なんとなくだよ」=“I don't really know, it's a mystery to me but, I just kinda like sweat.”
「汗かぁ、確かに本能にくるものがあるかも」=“Sweat, huh? I guess I can see it, there's something just instinctive about it.”
「な、なんの話だよこれ。色々思い出しちゃうだろ……」=“W-Why are we even talking about this? Now you're gonna make me remember a bunch of stuff...”
「欲求不満な時どうしてる？」=“What do you do when you feel sexually frustrated?”
「欲求不満……っていうのが、イマイチわかんないんだけど」=“Sexually frustrated... I don't really get what you mean by that.”
「ムラムラしてる時とか」=“Like when you feel horny and stuff.”
「普通にジョギングでもしてくればいいんじゃねーの」=“Doesn't regular old jogging work fine for that?”
「それでも収まらなかったら？」=“And if even jogging doesn't help fix it completely?”
「何を言わせようとしてるんだよ！　そんなん、倒れるまで走ってやる」=“Just what are you trying to get me to say here! I would just run until I fall in that case.”
「ねえ、初めての後大丈夫だった？　体調とか」=“Hey, were you okay after your first time? Like physically.”
「お前……そんなことストレートに聞くなよ」=“You... don't ask about that sorta stuff so directly.”
「粗相がなかったか気になって」=“Well I was just wondering if you had it rough or something after.”
「粗相ってなんだよ！？　……そりゃ、ちょっとは痛かったけど」=“Heck do you mean rough!? ...I mean, 'course, it hurt a bit but.”
「お前が優しくしてくれたの、わかってるし」=“I know you were being as gentle as you could have been.”
「……本当に可愛いね」=“...You're seriously adorable.”
「なんでそうなるんだよ！　は、反応がガキみたいだからってことか」=“How did you go from that to that!? W-Was it because I responded like a brat or something?”
「抱きしめてもいい？」=“Mind if I hug you?”
「ぐいぐいくるんじゃねーよ。お、お前、割とエッチだよな……」=“Don't come at me so straight. Y-You've got a real lewd side to you, you know...”
