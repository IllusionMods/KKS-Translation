「あはは、結構獰猛らしいから無理だと思うよ。それに貴重な動物だし……」=“I've heard they're pretty fierce, so I don't think it's possible. I don't think it's possible because they're pretty fierce and they're very precious. ......”

「あ……ふふっ、すごく優しい！　そういうとこ、君らしいよね」=“Oh ......, that's so sweet!　That's just like you, isn't it?”
「あはは、そうかな？　優しいというより、単なる興味本位だよ？」=“Haha, is that so?　It's not that I'm nice, I'm just curious.”
「それでもだよー。見守ってあげただけで十分優しいと思うな」=“But still. I think it's very kind of you to watch over them.”

「え、そうなの！？　いつから！？」=“Oh, really?　Since when?”
「けっこう前からかな？　ずっとお水あげてたよね？」=“Since quite a while, I guess.　You've been watering them for a long time, haven't you?”
「君ってお花にも優しいんだなーって思って、こっそり見てたの。ごめんね」=“I thought you were kind to flowers too, so I watched you secretly. Sorry.”
「そ、そうなんだ？　見られてたと思うと……ちょっと恥ずかしい……」=“I'm sorry. - Oh, really?　It's ...... a little embarrassing to think that I was being watched. ......”
