「そういえばさ、ホエールウォッチングとか気になる？」=“Reminds me, got any interest in whale watching?”
「クジラを見るの？　あは、いいね、すごく興味あるっ！」=“You can watch whales? Aha, that sounds nice, I'm super interested--!”
「あっ、でも……あんまり近いと怖いかも……船が転覆したりしない？」=“Ah--, but... I think getting close might be scary... won't the ship capsize?”
「うーん、さすがにそれはないと思うよ。ある程度の距離はあるんじゃない？」=“Nnn, I really don't think there's any danger of that. I mean, it gets pretty close but not that close, no?”
「あはは、そうだよね。だったらぜひ写真に撮ってみたいかもー！」=“Ahahah, you're right. I definitely wanna get a picture or two then~!”
「ヤシガニって知ってるかな？」=“Do you know what coconut crabs are?”
「あ、すっごく大きなヤドカリだよね！　前にテレビで見たことあるよ！」=“Ah, you mean those super big hermit crabs, right! I've seen them on TV before!”
「あ……その番組、もしかしたら俺も見たことあるかも……」=“Ah... I think I've seen the one you're thinking about too...”
「特集してたよね。確か大きくて長生きで……でも臆病だって言ってたっけ？」=“It was a special feature, wasn't it? If I remember right, they're big and long lived... but also very timid?”
「ぱっと見は怖そうに見えるけど、意外と可愛い感じもあるよね♪」=“They look pretty scary on the surface but, they're actually pretty cute things, aren't they~♪”
「ね、月桃って知ってる？　植物なんだけど……」=“Hey, you know shell gingers? It's a plant, for what it's worth...”
「え？　なにそれ、初めて聞いたかも！？　どんな植物？」=“Eh? What's that, it's the first I'm hearing of it I think?! What sorta plant is it?”
「ハーブに分類される植物で、結構綺麗な花が咲くんだよ」=“One that's classified as a herb, and with some very pretty flowers.”
「へぇ、ハーブって聞くと気になるなぁ。どんな植物なんだろう？」=“Heh, a herb, huh? Now I'm getting curious~. I wonder what sorta plant is it?”
「ハーブティーとかにもできるなら飲んでみたいな。あとで調べてみるね」=“If you can make herb tea with it too, I'd love to try some. I'll check it out later, thanks.”
「ヤマネコって興味ある？」=“Got any interest in wildcats?”
「あるある！　シュッとしてて可愛いよね！　撫で撫でしてみたい！」=“I do, I do! They're so nimble and adorable, aren't they! I wanna stroke one!”
「あはは、結構獰猛らしいから無理だと思うよ。それに貴重な動物だし……」=“Ahahah, they're very ferocious so I'd give up on that. Not to mention, they're very important animals...”
「えー、そうなの……慣れてくれても触っちゃダメなのかな？」=“Eh~, really... even if I get one used to being near me, I still can't stroke it?”
「どうなんだろう？　調べてみる？」=“I wonder? Wanna look into it?”
「うんっ！　もしも触れるんだったら、君と一緒に行きたいなぁ」=“Yeah--! If we really can stroke it, I wanna go and find one with you~”
「どっちに懐いてくれるか勝負したいよね、えへへ♪」=“We can have a little competition, over who it gets close to first, eheheh♪”
（あはは……噛まれる可能性は考えてないんだろうな、きっと）=(Ahahah... the thought of being bitten's probably not even crossed her mind.)
「流れ星ってさ、一瞬しか見えないのに、どうやって願い事するんだろう」=“You can only see shooting stars for less than a second before they disappear, just how are you supposed to even make a wish on them?”
「あはは、そんなの簡単だよー。いつでも心に願い事を浮かべておくの」=“Ahahah, that's easy~. You just always make the wish in your heart.”
「いつでも？　普段からってこと？」=“Always? All the time, you mean?”
「うん、そうだよ。心の中で、こうなったらいいなぁってことを浮かべておくの」=“Yeah, that's right. You always think about how you want things to be in your heart.”
「そうしたら、突然流れ星に出会えても、心には願い事が浮かんでるでしょ？」=“So even if you see a shooting star out of nowhere, you'll be wishing for what you want in your heart, no?”
「なるほど……確かにそっちの方が願いが叶いそうだよね」=“I see... that does feel like it'd make your wish be heard easier, for sure.”
「でしょでしょ？　だから私は今、この瞬間も願い事を心に浮かべてるのです！」=“Right, right? That's why I'm wishing for what I want even now!”
「えっ、どんなこと願ってるの？」=“Eh--, what are you wishing for?”
「それはねー……えへへっ、内緒だよっ♪」=“That's, you know~... eheheh--, it's a secret♪”
「サガリバナって聞いたことある？」=“Have you ever heard of mango pines?”
「あ、えっと……確か一晩だけ咲くお花……だよね？　違った？」=“Ah, erhm... you mean those flowers that only bloom for a night... right? Did I get it wrong?”
「そうそう。花のこと、詳しいんだね」=“Yep, those exactly. You know a lot about flowers.”
「あはは、そういうわけじゃないけど……昔読んだ少女漫画で出てきたんだ」=“Ahahah, not really... they just showed up in a shoujo manga I read a long time ago.”
「主人公と彼氏が二人でその花を見るシーンが印象的で……」=“The scene of the protagonist and her boyfriend looking at them together was so memorable...”
「ロマンチックな話なんだ？」=“Oh so it was a romantic story?”
「うん、すっごくいいお話だよ。今度、機会があったら貸してあげるね！」=“Yeah, it was very nice too. If I get the chance, I'll lend it to you sometime!”
「ちょっと安心したことがあってさ。実はずっと見守ってた鳥の雛が孵ったんだ」=“Something really relieving just happened. This little birdie I've actually been watching over finally hatched.”
「えっ、そうなの！？　ずっと見てたって……卵をずっと？」=“Eh--, really?! Always watching over the birdie... while it was an egg, you mean?”
「うん、たまたま見つけたら気になっちゃって……つい通っちゃった」=“Yeah, I just happened to find it one day and I couldn't help myself... so I ended up going everyday.”
「あ……ふふっ、すごく優しい！　そういうとこ、君らしいよね」=“Ah... fufuh--, that's so sweet! That's just like you, you know?”
「あはは、そうかな？　優しいというより、単なる興味本位だよ？」=“Ahahah, you think? I'd explain it more as just me being pretty interested in the process, you know?”
「それでもだよー。見守ってあげただけで十分優しいと思うな」=“Even so~. I think even just watching over it for that makes you pretty sweet.”
「きっと生まれた小鳥たちも、君に感謝してるよー。ありがとうって！」=“I'm sure even the little birdie is very thankful to you~. I bet it was even chirping "thank you"!”
「ははっ、だったら嬉しいかも。通った甲斐があるね」=“Hahah--, that'd be pretty nice. Would make it worth all that effort.”
「うんっ！　でもさすが君……そういうとこまで気にしてるなんて見直しちゃった」=“I'm sure--! But still... I didn't know you did that kind of stuff, that's a side of you I didn't know existed.”
「宿の庭にあるアサガオって見た？」=“Did you see that morning glory growing in the yard at the lodge house?”
「うん、見たよー！　青い綺麗なお花！　立派に咲いてたよね！」=“Yeah, I did~! Such a beautiful blue flower! It was blooming so nicely!”
「そっか。見てくれたんだ。あはは、綺麗だって思ってくれて良かった！」=“I see. So you saw it. Ahahah, well, I'm glad you liked it so much!”
「もちろんだよ。だって……君が大切にお世話してるの知ってるもん」=“Of course I did. I mean... I know how much you've been caring for it.”
「え、そうなの！？　いつから！？」=“Eh, you did!? Since when!?”
「けっこう前からかな？　ずっとお水あげてたよね？」=“A while ago, I guess? You've been watering it for a long while now, haven't you?”
「君ってお花にも優しいんだなーって思って、こっそり見てたの。ごめんね」=“You're just a sweetie even to flowers, aren't you? I've been watching you do that from the sidelines. I'm sorry for not telling.”
「そ、そうなんだ？　見られてたと思うと……ちょっと恥ずかしい……」=“Y-You have? That's... pretty embarrassing...”
「そんなことないよ。その……素敵な人だなって思ってたよ、えへへっ♪」=“Not at all. It uhm... it made me realize just how wonderful you are, eheheh♪”
「マンタがたくさん泳いでるとこって見てみたいよね」=“It'd be pretty nice to see a whole school of mantas swimming together atleast once, wouldn't it?”
「あっ、見てみたい！　マンタって泳いでるっていうよりも飛んでるみたいだよね！」=“Ah--, yeah, it would! Mantas look less like they swim and more like they fly through the water, don't they!”
「下から見上げたら、太陽の光を浴びて……すごく綺麗そう……」=“Imagine, looking up at one from below, basking in the rays of the sun poking through... it'd be so beautiful...”
「あ、確かに……想像できるかも……絵になりそうだね」=“Ah, you're right... I think I can imagine it... what a perfect picture that'd be, huh?”
「うん、いいなぁ……いつかそういう写真も撮ってみたいなぁ……」=“Yeah, it'd be so nice... I wanna take a picture like that someday~”
「海ほたるって綺麗だよね」=“Sea fireflies are really pretty, aren't they?”
「うん、キラキラ光って、波でゆらゆら揺れて……あれも虫……なんだよね？」=“Yeah, the way they glitter, and sway with the tide... they're... insects too, aren't they?”
「虫……なのかなぁ？　甲殻類らしいけど……そういうの苦手じゃない？」=“I... guess? They're apparently categorized as crustaceans... either way, you don't like being around those, right?”
「ううん、平気。だって普通のホタルだって虫だけど綺麗だもん」=“No, I'm fine with them. I mean, regular fireflies are insects too, and they're also pretty.”
「それに海ほたるはもっとスケールが大きいし……ずっと眺めていたくなるよね♪」=“Not to mention, sea fireflies are so much bigger, scale-wise... it's hard to keep your eyes off them, isn't it?♪”
「ウミガメってさ、すっごく長生きなんだよね。この間調べて驚いたよ」=“Sea turtles live very long, don't they? It really shocked me when I found that out.”
「あ、えーっと……確か１００年以上生きる子もいるんだよね？」=“Ah, erhm... if I remember right, there's even been some that are older than 100 years old, right?”
「そうそう。人間よりも長生きで……すごいよね」=“Exactly. They live even longer than humans do... it's amazing, isn't it?”
「うん、それに……なんとなくだけど、のんびり生きてる感じがいいなぁ……」=“Yeah, not to mention... it's just a feeling, but I feel like they take life really easy...”
「あはは、実際は生存競争もあるだろうけど……確かに優雅に見えるよね」=“Ahahah, they probably do have their own troubles, just like we do... but yeah, they do look pretty chill, don't they?”
「うん、急いでないっていうか……マイペースっていうか……」=“Yep, it's like they're not in a rush... like they go about life at their own pace...”
「でも確か……生まれたばかりの時はすごく頑張って海に向かうんだよね」=“But if I remember right... It takes a whole lot out of them to go into the sea as newborns, doesn't it?”
「そうだね。小さな頃は危険がいっぱいだって書いてたよ」=“Yeah. The book I read said that it's especially dangerous for them when they're that young.”
「そっか、やっぱり一生懸命生きてるんだね。よーし、私も負けないように、一生懸命頑張ろう！」=“I see. I guess they really are trying their hardest too, huh? Alright, I'll do my best too, I'm not gonna lose!”
「星の砂ってなんだかお洒落なネーミングだよね」=“Starsand is a pretty stylish name, isn't it?”
「あ、分かる！　どこか別の星にある砂みたいなイメージだもんね」=“Ah, yeah! It gives it that otherworldly feel, doesn't it? Like it's from another planet.”
「実際は星形の砂……だよね。そういう名前にしなかったところがセンスあるなぁ」=“It's actually just star shaped sand... isn't it? Pretty sensible of them, to not name it that way, "star-shaped sand" and all.”
「一体誰が付けたんだろうね。星の砂……うん、お洒落」=“I wonder just who came up with it. Starsand... yep, very stylish.”
「瓶詰めされてるのを見ると、なんだか遠い世界の出来事が想像できそう」=“When I look at some bottled up, it almost makes me think of stuff going on on another planet.”
「あぁ、そういう考え方いいなぁ。俺も今度見た時は宇宙を想像してみるよ」=“Aah, that's a pretty nice way of thinking. Maybe I'll try to imagine something like that too, next time.”
「ウムイの鐘を二人で鳴らすと結ばれるって聞いたんだけど……」=“I've heard that if you ring the bell of Umuy together, you'll be tied by fate...”
「うん、知ってる知ってる！　いいよね！　素敵だよね！」=“Yep, I know of that! It's nice, isn't it! So wonderful, isn't it!”
「あはは、やっぱり知ってるんだ。そういうのって信じる？」=“Ahahah, so you did know. You believe in that stuff?”
「もちろん信じるよー。そうやって結ばれた人たちがいっぱいいるんだもん！」=“Of course~. There's a whole lot of couples that were tied together like that, you know!”
「きっとね、みんなの幸せな気持ちが詰まってる鐘なんだから、どんどん幸せを呼ぶんだよ」=“I bet it's because it's packed full of happiness that it's received from everyone, that's why it can pour it down so easily.”
「なるほど、みんなの幸せな気持ちか……そう考えると、すごく良い音が鳴りそうだよね」=“I see, everyone's happiness, huh... when you think about it that way, it does seem like it'd have a pretty nice ring to it, for sure.”
「あのさ、俺、きみの胸が……」=“Listen, you know, your chest is just...”
「ま、待って待ってーっ！　いきなり何を言うのかな？」=“W-Wait, wait~! What're you even saying?”
「あ、いや……好きだなぁって言おうと思って……」=“Ah, just... I just thought I'd tell you how much I love it...”
「はぅっ……む、胸が好きっ……ということは、胸以外は……」=“Hauu--... l-love my chest--... so you mean that, aside from my chest, you don't...”
「あーっ、違う違う！　そういう意味じゃないよ！？　胸も好きってこと！」=“Aah, no no! I didn't mean it that way, okay?! I love your chest too, is what I meant!”
「ひあぁっ！　う、嬉しいけど、あんまり大きな声で言うことじゃないよぉ！」=“Hyaah--! I-I'm really happy but, that's not something you should be shouting out like that!”
「何かフェチな部分とかある？」=“Got any particular kink or fetish?”
「あ、あはは……ストレートな質問……ちょっとエッチだよー」=“A-Ahahah... what a straight ball... you're being a bit lewd~”
「あ……と……ごめん、気になっちゃって……聞いちゃダメ？」=“Ah... uh... sorry, I just got curious... should I not ask?”
「うーん、ダメじゃないけど……フェチ……フェチかぁ……難しいなぁ……」=“Nuh-uh, it's okay... a kink... a kink, huh... so hard...”
「あ、そうだ、あえていうならシチュエーションフェチ……かな？　えへへ」=“Ah, right, if I had to pick something, I guess it'd be a particular situation... maybe? Eheheh.”
（シチュエーション……あはは、これはまた難しそうなフェチだ……）=(A particular situation... ahahah, that sounds like a pretty hard fetish to please...)
「欲求不満な時はどうしてるの？」=“What do you do when you feel frustrated?”
「ひゃあぁっ！　いきなりなんて質問しちゃうのー！？」=“Hyaah--! What're you even asking so suddenly~?!”
「いや、ほら……たまにはそういうことも聞いてみたいなと思って……」=“No well, you know... I just wanted to try asking that sorta question once in my life, you know...”
「よ、欲求不満って……その……え、エッチな意味……だよね？」=“F-Frustrated... uhm... y-you mean sexually... right?”
「うん、そのつもりだけど……」=“Yeah, that was what I meant...”
「そ、そうだなぁ……汗をかくとか……わぁぁ、やっぱりダメ！　何言っても変な意味みたいになっちゃうよーっ！」=“L-Let's see... I go and work up a swe... waah, nevermind! No matter what I say, it'll sound weird~!”
「えーっと……いきなりだけど……初体験ってどうだった……かな？」=“Eerhm... I know it's sudden but... how was our first time... for you?”
「ふぇっ……は、初体験っ！？　そ、それはっ、そのっ……えーっと……」=“Fueh--... o-our first time--?! T-That's--, uhm--... erhm...”
「じーっ……」=“*stare*...”
「はぅっ……そ、そんな期待に満ちた目で見ないでよー！」=“Hauu--... d-don't look at me with those eyes full of expectation~!”
「しょ、正直に言うとね……ちょっとだけ……痛かったです……」=“I-If I'm being honest... it did... hurt a tiny bit...”
「っ……ガーン！」=“--!... Gah--!”
「わぁぁ、ち、違うよー！　別に嫌だったわけじゃないの！」=“Waah, I-I didn't mean it that way~! It's not like I hated it or anything!”
「その痛みも含めて……君に捧げられて良かったなって思ってるんだよ。えへへ」=“I really do feel glad that you were the one who took my virginity... that pain included. Eheheh~”
