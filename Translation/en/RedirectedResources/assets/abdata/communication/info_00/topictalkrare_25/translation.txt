「ホエールウォッチングって面白いのかな？」=“You think whale watching's any fun?”
「ん～？　面白いとかつまらないとかのやつではないような～」=“Nn~? I feel like it's not really the sort of thing that'd be "fun" or "boring", you know~?”
「興味ある？」=“You interested in it?”
「愚問っすね。私は大抵のことに興味がないんだよ～」=“What a dumb question. I'm not interested in most things, you know~”
「なんだかクジラみたいな生き方だね」=“That's a very whale-like lifestyle.”
「クジラに自己投影は無理かなぁ？　身体が大きすぎて燃費悪そう～」=“I wonder if I could project myself into being a whale~? Then again, they're way too big, I bet their energy efficiency is awful~”
「ヤシガニって可愛いと思う？」=“Do you think coconut crabs are cute?”
「ヤシガニってあれでしょ？　ちょきーん」=“By coconut crabs, you mean those snip-snip guys, right?”
「そうそう、でっかいハサミの」=“Exactly, the ones with the big scissor hands.”
「あれを可愛いと思う人は、そこそこ特殊な趣味だと思うっす」=“I think it takes very unique tastes, to be able to think of them as cute.”
「でも、よく見ると顔は可愛いんだよ。目がつぶらで」=“But, they actually have pretty cute faces, up close. You know, with big beady eyes and all.”
「…………へ～」=“...Heh~”
（すぐ聞き流す……）=(Through one ear and out the other...)
「月桃って特徴的な香りだよね」=“Shell gingers have a pretty unique scent, don't they?”
「わかんな～い、そう言うんだったらそうなんじゃない？」=“I dunno~, probably?”
「……月桃が何なのかは分かってるよね？」=“...I hope you know what they are, atleast?”
「多分、どっかで見たかもね～」=“Might have seen them around somewhere, maybe~”
「せっかく旅先なんだし、もうちょっと物事に興味を持ってもいいのでは……」=“We're on a once-in-a-lifetime trip, you could atleast try to be interested in the things here...”
「持ってるっすよ。そのげっとーって言うのも嗅げばああこれねーってなるだろうし～」=“I am, I am. I probably know what it is, I bet if you brought me one, I'd remember from the smell~”
「それは絶対ウソだわ」=“I'm not falling for that.”
「ヤマネコの生き様ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of the way wildcats live?”
「え～、絶対無理っす。毎日、獲物捕まえて生きてるんでしょ？　ほぼサバンナだよ～」=“Eh~, I could never. They hunt and eat prey to survive, no? That's like, wild and shit~”
「まあ、言いたいことはちょっとわかる」=“Well, I get what you mean, I guess.”
「野生動物は、私にはちょっとハードルが高すぎるっす」=“Their way of life is like too extreme for someone like me.”
「もし死んで生まれ変わる時、『ヤマネコどう？』って聞かれたら丁重にお断わりするな～」=“If god asks me "how about a wildcat?" when I'm coming back down again after death, I would politely refuse that offer~”
「そんなノリ？」=“You're that into it, huh?”
「せめて、家猫でお願いしま～すって」=“I'd dogeza and ask to be a housecat instead~”
「……家猫はむしろ、しっくりきそうな印象が」=“...I feel like that would fit you to a T, yeah.”
「食っちゃ寝してれば勝手にちやほやしてくれるんだもんね？　理想だよ～」=“All I'd have to do is eat and sleep and they'd fawn over me all by themselves, wouldn't they? Now that's the ideal life~”
「流れ星って今まで見たことある？」=“Ever seen any shooting stars before?”
「どうだろね～？　あるような～、ないような～～……」=“Who knows~? I feel like I have~, or maybe not~...”
「見ても覚えてないだけという噂が」=“Rumour has it that she doesn't remember the things she sees.”
「星とか四六時中流れてるんだし、そんなにありがたいものではないでしょ～？」=“Stars shoot around all the time, twenty-four-seven. Are they really that big a deal~?”
「いやその、この辺りは流星群が有名で……」=“No well, the meteor showers around here are pretty famous so...”
「見てどうするの？　お願いごとするの？」=“And what'll you do if you see one? Gonna make a wish?”
「見たらするかもね」=“I might.”
「私は別にお願いすることないかなぁ？　充分、満たされてるからね～」=“I don't really have much of anything to wish for, I'd say. I'm pretty satisfied with things, honestly~”
（マイペースだもんなぁ……）=(She really doesn't let anything mess up her beat, huh...)
「わかるよぉ、それは失礼なことを考えてる顔だね～？」=“I can tell from your face, you're thinking something rude there, aren't you~?”
「サガリバナって、ちょっと物悲しいよね……」=“Mango pines are pretty sad flowers, aren't they?”
「咲いてすぐ花が落ちちゃうから、みたいなこと？　う～ん……」=“The way they wilt right after they bloom? Nnn~...”
「まあ、長く咲いたら偉いってものでもないしね～」=“I mean, it's not like blooming for a long time makes a flower great or anything~”
「それ言ったらそうだけどさ」=“I mean, yeah, but still.”
「キミみたいな優しい人がそう思ってくれるなら、浮かばれるってものだよ～」=“With a sweet guy like you thinking that way about them, I'm sure they're able to rest in peace too~”
（何視点……？）=(What sort of a viewpoint...?)
「キミにとっては儚い命でも、案外本人は満足してるかもだし」=“I mean, to you it might seem like a pretty short life but, you never know, they might be pretty satisfied with it.”
「私がサガリバナでも『あ、一晩でいいです』って言うだろうしね～」=“If I was one of them, I'd probably be going「Ah, I'm fine with just one night here」too~”
「もっと生きることに真剣になろうか」=“Let's become a bit more serious about living, shall we?”
「よく覗きに行ってた鳥の巣で、こないだ雛が孵ってたんだ」=“So there's this birds' nest I go and check up on a lot, and the egg in it hatched just the other day.”
「どうせ、リアクションはそんなもんだと思ったよ」=“Not that I expected much of a reaction anyway.”
「興味がないわけじゃないんだけどね～。鳥の雛は可愛いだろうし～」=“It's not like I'm not interested or anything~. I bet it's a real cutie~”
「そうそう、ふわふわで綿みたいだよ」=“Definitely, it's so soft, like a boll of cotton.”
「鳴くの～？」=“Does it chirp~?”
「そりゃ鳴くよ。ちっちゃいから鳴き声まで可愛いんだ」=“Well, of course. It's really tiny so even its chirps are adorable.”
「お～、それはよかった～」=“Oh~, I'm glad to hear that~”
「見に行ってみたい？」=“You wanna go see it?”
「ううん、別に～」=“No, not really~”
「そうだろうと思ったよ」=“I had a feeling.”
「庭のアサガオに水をやってたら、この前、花が咲いてたよ」=“I started watering this morning glory in the yard, and the flowers finally bloomed the other day.”
「お～、庭の……」=“Oh~, the flowers in the...”
「ん？　それ、いつの話かな」=“Nn? When did that happen? Before we came here?”
「こっちに来てから。民宿の庭に植木鉢があるでしょ？」=“After. There's flowerpots in the yard, no?”
「……そんなのあったっけ？」=“...There are?”
「あるんだって。まったく、この感動を分かちあいたかったのに……」=“There are. Jeez, and here I wanted to share some of my emotions with you...”
「私はお世話してないしね～」=“Not like I did anything~”
「そりゃそうだけど」=“I mean, yeah but still.”
「拗ねない、拗ねない。よしよし、偉いね～？　いい子いい子～」=“Don't sulk, don't sulk. There there, good boy~. Good job, good job~”
（まあ、これはこれで……）=(Well, this doesn't feel all that...)
「知ってた？　マンタって異名なんだよ」=“Did you know? The name "manta" is just an alias.”
「……あだ名みたいなこと～？」=“...Like a nickname~?”
「そうそう。正式にはオニイトマキエイ……だったかな？」=“Exactly. The scientific name was... Mobula birostris, if I remember right?”
「どこにもマンの要素ないね～」=“No part of that sounds like "manta", you're right~”
「マントみたいだからマンタなんだってさ」=“Apparently, they're called mantas because they look like mantles.”
「……あー、太ってるからぶーちゃんみたいなものか～」=“...Ah~, like calling a girl "piggy" because she's fat, huh~?”
「海ほたるの正体って知ってる？」=“Do you know what sea fireflies actually are?”
「……枯尾花？」=“...Withered silver grass?”
「会話が雑すぎてがっかりするよ。もしかして眠い？」=“That's so random I'm honestly not sure what to say. Are you sleepy?”
「フリかと思って～。海ほたるの正体だっけ？　聞いてた聞いてた」=“I thought you were going for a joke~. What sea fireflies actually are? I was listening, see.”
「あれって実は……」=“They're actually...”
「ミジンコの仲間だね～。群れで行動してて、なんでも食べるわんぱくな連中なんだよ～」=“A kind of water flea, aren't they~. They always move around in herds, and are a naughty bunch that can eat just about anything~”
「普通に詳しいとか」=“So you actually know.”
「ウミガメってやっぱり憧れる？」=“Do you idolize sea turtles after all?”
「やっぱりってなに～？　憧れないよ、ウミガメには～」=“What's that 'after all' for~? I don't, why would I~?”
「そう？　好きそうだと思ったんだけど」=“That so? I really thought you'd like them.”
「泣きながら卵を産むんすよ？　しかも、年に何回も」=“They lay eggs while crying, you know? Lots of times per year too.”
「考えれば考えるほど、ウミガメの日常はカロリーが高すぎるよ～」=“The more I think about it, the more calorie expenditure heavy their lives seem~”
「どんな生き物も大変ってことか」=“It's hard being alive, no matter what you are, huh?”
「ほんと、ほんと。人間さんも忙しいしね～、はあ、やれやれ～」=“For real, for real. Us humans have it tough too~. Haah, good grief~”
「せめて何かしながら言ってくれる？　そういうの」=“Could you atleast busy yourself with something while you say that? Please?”
「星の砂っていったら、やっぱりお土産かな」=“When you think "starsand", I guess souvenirs come to mind first out of everything else?”
「……う～ん、まあ、ペナントとか木刀とかと近い感覚かもね～」=“...Nnn~, well, I guess it does feel pretty similar to a pennant or a wooden sword or something~”
「木刀はどうかな」=“I dunno about a wodden sword.”
「星の砂って、業者さんはどうやって集めてるんだろうね～？」=“I wonder how they even gather starsand to begin with~?”
「潮干狩りみたいに、かな……」=“Like clamming, I guess?...”
「んふふ、想像したらなんか面白いかも。真心こもってそう～」=“Nnfufuh, that sounds pretty interesting. Bet they fill it full of love and care~”
「丹精込めて育てましたって？　野菜じゃないんだから」=“They're not vegetables that they grow themselves, you know.”
「ウムイの鐘みたいな場所って他にもあるのかな？」=“I wonder if there's other places like the Bell of Umuy around.”
「恋のジンクスみたいなやつ～？　結構、あちこちにありそうだよね～」=“You mean like a love charm or whatever~? Feels like there'd be a bunch all over, doesn't it?~”
「旅行って恋人と行くこと多そうだし～」=“A lot of people do go travelling as couples too, after all~”
「客寄せってこと？　そう聞くと途端に夢がなくなるな」=“So basically capitalism, huh? Suddenly it doesn't feel even a bit romantic.”
「そうやって想いが集まる分、ご利益ましましになったりして～」=“And the more people's feelings gather up together, the more effect it actually starts having~”
「それはどういうルール？」=“And what are you even basing that on?”
「男はおっぱいが好きなわけだけど、女の子はそういう見られ方は嫌なもの？」=“Just about all men love boobs but, do girls hate being looked at that way?”
「ん～……嫌ってほどではないよ～。減るものじゃないしね～」=“Nn~... I wouldn't say "hate"~. I mean, it's not like you looking is gonna make them smaller or anything~”
「おっぱいで満足してくれるなら、楽……とかもありそう～？」=“And if boobs are enough to make you happy, that's just perfect... so there's that too~?”
「そこに面倒くさい要素は持ち込んで欲しくないかも……」=“It's always about the hassle with you, isn't it?...”
「謎なのは、おっぱいいじられてる時に女はどうしてればいいかなんだよね～」=“What I want to know is, as a woman, what should I even do while you play with my boobs, you know~?”
「そんな冷静さを吹き飛ばしたいよね、男としては」=“And as a man, I'd like nothing more than to blow away all pointless thoughts like that.”
「我を失っちゃうようなフェチとかってあったりする？」=“Do you have any kinks or fetishes that really make you forget yourself?”
「う～ん、私はそういうこだわりとかとは無縁に生きてるからな～……」=“Nnn~, you know that I try to live my life without having things like that, right~?...”
「確かに受け身っぽい印象はあるかも」=“You do give off a very bottom vibe, for sure.”
「受け身って……そんな言い方したら、私がマゾの人みたいだよ～」=“A bottom... you're making me sound like a masochist~”
「そうはっきりは言わないけど、どっちかだったら？」=“I mean, I wouldn't say it directly, but if it was between the two, which would you pick?”
「…………まあ、マゾかも」=“...Well, I guess I'm a masochist, yeah.”
「欲求不満って本当に辛いよね」=“Being sexually frustrated truly is hell, isn't it?”
「誰でもいいの、めちゃくちゃにして～！」=“I don't care who it is, just make a mess out of me~!”
「……みたいな？」=“...Frustrated like that?”
「誰でもいいはタマりすぎでは」=“Anyone, really? You sure you're not too bottled up?”
「例えばだよ。むしろ、辛いとか言ってるキミの方がそういうのでしょ～？」=“It was just an example. Heck, you're the one who brought it up, aren't you feeling it yourself~?”
「めちゃくちゃにはしたいけど、誰でもいいわけでは……」=“Well, I wouldn't be fine with just anyone myself, you know...”
「初体験のことを思い返すと……あはは、ニヤニヤしちゃうね」=“When I think back to our first time... ahahah, I'm grinning just thinking about it.”
「それ、変なこと思い出しちゃうってこと？　意地悪だよ～」=“Thinking some weird stuff right now? That's not very nice~”
「会うたびにちょっと過っちゃうんだって。その、すごく……可愛かったから」=“It just happens on its own whenever I see you. Since you were, you know... super adorable.”
「普通にしてただけだよ～」=“I was just being myself~”
「全然、いつも通りじゃなかったよ。あんな風に……」=“No way, you definitely weren't the way you always are. You were so...”
「解説しないでいいから～！」=“I'm good, keep it to yourself~!”
「と、とにかく、俺にとってすごく特別で幸せなことだったから……それでつい」=“A-Anyways, to me it was a really special and a happy moment so... I just can't help it.”
「まあ、嫌な思い出になるよりはいいけど～」=“Well, I guess it's better than you having a trauma about it~”
「あの後、身体とか平気だった？」=“Were you fine after that? Like physically and whatnot.”
「だから、普通だってば～」=“I told you, I was fine~”
