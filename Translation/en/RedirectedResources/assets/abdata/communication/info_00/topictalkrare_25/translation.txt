「ホエールウォッチングって面白いのかな？」=“I guess whale watching would be interesting, wouldn't it?”
「ん～？　面白いとかつまらないとかのやつではないような～」=“Nh~?　It's not like it's interesting, or boring~”
「興味ある？」=“Are you interested?”
「愚問っすね。私は大抵のことに興味がないんだよ～」=“Silly question. Most things don't interest me~”
「なんだかクジラみたいな生き方だね」=“You kind of have a whale's way of life.”
「クジラに自己投影は無理かなぁ？　身体が大きすぎて燃費悪そう～」=“Not sure if I can project myself as a whale, you know?　Their bodies look to big to be fuel efficient~”
「ヤシガニって可愛いと思う？」=“Do you think coconut crabs are cute?”
「ヤシガニってあれでしょ？　ちょきーん」=“Palm crabs... those things? Those pincers- nhh.”
「そうそう、でっかいハサミの」=“Right, the ones with the big pincers.”
「あれを可愛いと思う人は、そこそこ特殊な趣味だと思うっす」=“If you think they're cute, you must have a very particular taste.”
「でも、よく見ると顔は可愛いんだよ。目がつぶらで」=“But if you look closely, they have cute faces. Little doll eyes.”
「…………へ～」=“...ahem~”
（すぐ聞き流す……）=(I'll give her time to think about it...)
「月桃って特徴的な香りだよね」=“Shell ginger has a distinctive scent, doesn't it?”
「わかんな～い、そう言うんだったらそうなんじゃない？」=“I dunno~ Well, if you say so, then that's right, isn't it?”
「……月桃が何なのかは分かってるよね？」=“...do you even know what shell ginger is?”
「多分、どっかで見たかもね～」=“I might have seen it somewhere~”
「せっかく旅先なんだし、もうちょっと物事に興味を持ってもいいのでは……」=“We're travelling, so maybe it'd be okay if you were a little more interested in things...”
「持ってるっすよ。そのげっとーって言うのも嗅げばああこれねーってなるだろうし～」=“I get it. So yeah- If I smelled it, I'd be like- yeah, that's it~”
「それは絶対ウソだわ」=“That's definitely a lie.”
「ヤマネコの生き様ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of the wildcat's way of life?”
「え～、絶対無理っす。毎日、獲物捕まえて生きてるんでしょ？　ほぼサバンナだよ～」=“Eh~ There's no way I could do it. Having to catch prey, every day? On the savannah~”
「まあ、言いたいことはちょっとわかる」=“Well, I kind of get what you're saying.”
「野生動物は、私にはちょっとハードルが高すぎるっす」=“Wild animals are a little too much for me.”
「もし死んで生まれ変わる時、『ヤマネコどう？』って聞かれたら丁重にお断わりするな～」=“I were to die, and someone asked me if I wanted to be reborn as a wildcat, I'd politely decline~”
「そんなノリ？」=“Just like that?”
「せめて、家猫でお願いしま～すって」=“A housecat, at lease, please~”
「……家猫はむしろ、しっくりきそうな印象が」=“...I have the impression a housecat would be a better fit for you.”
「食っちゃ寝してれば勝手にちやほやしてくれるんだもんね？　理想だよ～」=“As long as you eat and sleep, they'll pamper you on their own, right? Perfect~”
「流れ星って今まで見たことある？」=“Have you ever seen a shooting star?”
「どうだろね～？　あるような～、ないような～～……」=“I dunno~?.　I don't know. Maybe I have~ Maybe I haven't~~...”
「見ても覚えてないだけという噂が」=“Rumor has it that you just don't remember seeing it.”
「星とか四六時中流れてるんだし、そんなにありがたいものではないでしょ～？」=“Stars and stuff are flowing all the time, so it's not like we anything to be grateful for, you know~?”
「いやその、この辺りは流星群が有名で……」=“No, um, what I meant is that this area's famous for meteor showers...”
「見てどうするの？　お願いごとするの？」=“What are gonna do if you see them?　Are you gonna to make a wish?”
「見たらするかもね」=“I might.”
「私は別にお願いすることないかなぁ？　充分、満たされてるからね～」=“I don't think I have anything to wish for, you know?　I've got enough as it is~”
（マイペースだもんなぁ……）=(She just goes at her own pace...)
「わかるよぉ、それは失礼なことを考えてる顔だね～？」=“I know you're thinking something rude right now, okay~?”
「サガリバナって、ちょっと物悲しいよね……」=“Sagaribanas are kind of sad, aren't they...?”
「咲いてすぐ花が落ちちゃうから、みたいなこと？　う～ん……」=“You mean the way their flowers fall off, right after blooming?　Hmmm...”
「まあ、長く咲いたら偉いってものでもないしね～」=“Well, they wouldn't be as big of a deal if the flowers lasted longer~”
「それ言ったらそうだけどさ」=“Well, when you put it that way.”
「キミみたいな優しい人がそう思ってくれるなら、浮かばれるってものだよ～」=“It would be nice to be remembered by someone as kind as you~”
（何視点……？）=(What's with that point of view...?)
「キミにとっては儚い命でも、案外本人は満足してるかもだし」=“Even if you only had a fleeting life, you still might end up unexpectedly satisfied.”
「私がサガリバナでも『あ、一晩でいいです』って言うだろうしね～」=“If I were a sagaribana, I'd probably say, 'Ah, one night is fine.~'”
「もっと生きることに真剣になろうか」=“Maybe you should take life more seriously.”
「よく覗きに行ってた鳥の巣で、こないだ雛が孵ってたんだ」=“There's this bird's nest I was spying on, and chicks hatched the other day.”
「どうせ、リアクションはそんなもんだと思ったよ」=“That's how I though you would react, anyway.”
「興味がないわけじゃないんだけどね～。鳥の雛は可愛いだろうし～」=“It's not that I'm not interested~ I'm sure the chicks are adorable~”
「そうそう、ふわふわで綿みたいだよ」=“Yeah, you know, they're so fluffy, like cotton balls.”
「鳴くの～？」=“Do they sing~?”
「そりゃ鳴くよ。ちっちゃいから鳴き声まで可愛いんだ」=“They chirp. They're so tiny, even their chirps are cute.”
「お～、それはよかった～」=“Ohh~ That's good~”
「見に行ってみたい？」=“Do you want to go see them?”
「ううん、別に～」=“No, not really~”
「そうだろうと思ったよ」=“I knew you wouldn't.”
「庭のアサガオに水をやってたら、この前、花が咲いてたよ」=“I've been watering the morning glories in the garden, and they bloomed the other day.”
「お～、庭の……」=“Ohh~ The garden...”
「ん？　それ、いつの話かな」=“Nh? When was that?”
「こっちに来てから。民宿の庭に植木鉢があるでしょ？」=“Since I've been here. Have you seen the flower pots in the guest house garden?”
「……そんなのあったっけ？」=“...I don't remember seeing anything, you know?”
「あるんだって。まったく、この感動を分かちあいたかったのに……」=“They're there. Damn, I wanted to share my excitement with you...”
「私はお世話してないしね～」=“I don't take care of them~”
「そりゃそうだけど」=“Well, that's true, but...”
「拗ねない、拗ねない。よしよし、偉いね～？　いい子いい子～」=“No sulking, no sulking. Right, right, great, then~? Good job, good job~”
（まあ、これはこれで……）=(Well, there you have it...)
「知ってた？　マンタって異名なんだよ」=“Did you know?　'Manta' is just an alias.”
「……あだ名みたいなこと～？」=“...so it's like a nickname~?”
「そうそう。正式にはオニイトマキエイ……だったかな？」=“Right, yeah. It's officially called a manta ray... I guess?”
「どこにもマンの要素ないね～」=“There's no 'man' in there.”
「マントみたいだからマンタなんだってさ」=“They call them manta rays because they look like capes, mantles.”
「……あー、太ってるからぶーちゃんみたいなものか～」=“...Ah- so they'd call them 'bu-chan' if they were fat~”
「海ほたるの正体って知ってる？」=“Do you know what a sea fireflies are?”
「……枯尾花？」=“...withered silver grass?”
「会話が雑すぎてがっかりするよ。もしかして眠い？」=“Your conversation is so disjointed it's discouraging. Are you sleepy?”
「フリかと思って～。海ほたるの正体だっけ？　聞いてた聞いてた」=“I thought you were just messing with me~ The sea fireflies' true identity? I've heard, I've heard.”
「あれって実は……」=“They're actually...”
「ミジンコの仲間だね～。群れで行動してて、なんでも食べるわんぱくな連中なんだよ～」=“They're Daphnia Manga. They live in groups, eat everything, and are a rambunctious bunch~”
「普通に詳しいとか」=“And you just knew all that?”
「ウミガメってやっぱり憧れる？」=“I expect you admire sea turtles?”
「やっぱりってなに～？　憧れないよ、ウミガメには～」=“What do you mean, 'expect'~?　I don't admire sea turtles~”
「そう？　好きそうだと思ったんだけど」=“Really?　I thought you might like them.”
「泣きながら卵を産むんすよ？　しかも、年に何回も」=“They lay eggs while crying, you know?　And several times a year.”
「考えれば考えるほど、ウミガメの日常はカロリーが高すぎるよ～」=“The more I think about it, the more I realize how many calories are in a sea turtle's daily routine~”
「どんな生き物も大変ってことか」=“That's hard work for any living creature.”
「ほんと、ほんと。人間さんも忙しいしね～、はあ、やれやれ～」=“True, true. And humans are so busy, too~ *Sigh* man, geez~”
「せめて何かしながら言ってくれる？　そういうの」=“Could you maybe say that while doing something?　Or something.”
「星の砂っていったら、やっぱりお土産かな」=“I guess star sand is a souvenir, after all.”
「……う～ん、まあ、ペナントとか木刀とかと近い感覚かもね～」=“...hmmm, well, maybe it's similar to a flag, or a wooden sword~”
「木刀はどうかな」=“I'm not sure about wooden swords.”
「星の砂って、業者さんはどうやって集めてるんだろうね～？」=“I wonder how the vendors collect star sand?”
「潮干狩りみたいに、かな……」=“At the tide pools, I guess...”
「んふふ、想像したらなんか面白いかも。真心こもってそう～」=“Nfufu, it's kinda funny to imagine it. So sincerely cultivated~”
「丹精込めて育てましたって？　野菜じゃないんだから」=“You're saying they cultivate them with great care?　They're not vegetables.”
「ウムイの鐘みたいな場所って他にもあるのかな？」=“I wonder if there are any other places like the Umui Bell?”
「恋のジンクスみたいなやつ～？　結構、あちこちにありそうだよね～」=“Like, with a love jinx~?　They seem to be all over the place~”
「旅行って恋人と行くこと多そうだし～」=“Lovers often travel with each other~”
「客寄せってこと？　そう聞くと途端に夢がなくなるな」=“So, it's just a customer attraction?　When I hear that, my dreams instantly vanish.”
「そうやって想いが集まる分、ご利益ましましになったりして～」=“The more emotions they gather in this way, the more profitable they are~.”
「それはどういうルール？」=“What kind of rule is that?”
「男はおっぱいが好きなわけだけど、女の子はそういう見られ方は嫌なもの？」=“So, like, men love boobs... but women don't like to be looked at that way, do they?”
「ん～……嫌ってほどではないよ～。減るものじゃないしね～」=“Nh~... It's not as bad as it sounds~ And it's not like that's ever going to change~”
「おっぱいで満足してくれるなら、楽……とかもありそう～？」=“So, if you're happy with my boobs, take pleasure... or something like that~?”
「そこに面倒くさい要素は持ち込んで欲しくないかも……」=“Well, maybe we don't want the harassment factor there...”
「謎なのは、おっぱいいじられてる時に女はどうしてればいいかなんだよね～」=“The mystery is what women are supposed to do, when their boobs are being messed with~”
「そんな冷静さを吹き飛ばしたいよね、男としては」=“As a man, I'd like to blow some of that calmness out of the water.”
「我を失っちゃうようなフェチとかってあったりする？」=“Do you have any fetishes that make you lose your mind?”
「う～ん、私はそういうこだわりとかとは無縁に生きてるからな～……」=“Hmm, I don't have any obsessions, or anything like that~...”
「確かに受け身っぽい印象はあるかも」=“You certainly give off a really passive vibe.”
「受け身って……そんな言い方したら、私がマゾの人みたいだよ～」=“Passive? ...you make it sound like I'm a masochist.”
「そうはっきりは言わないけど、どっちかだったら？」=“I wouldn't put it that bluntly, but what if it's one or the other?”
「…………まあ、マゾかも」=“...well, maybe you're a masochist.”
「欲求不満って本当に辛いよね」=“It's really hard to be frustrated, isn't it?”
「誰でもいいの、めちゃくちゃにして～！」=“It doesn't matter who you are, just mess me up~!”
「……みたいな？」=“...you'd like that?”
「誰でもいいはタマりすぎでは」=“I'm thinking that 'anyone' is a bit too much.”
「例えばだよ。むしろ、辛いとか言ってるキミの方がそういうのでしょ～？」=“I'm just saying. You're the one who's saying it's hard.”
「めちゃくちゃにはしたいけど、誰でもいいわけでは……」=“I'd like someone to mess me up, but not just anyone...”
「初体験のことを思い返すと……あはは、ニヤニヤしちゃうね」=“Thinking back our first time... ahaha, I can't help but grin.”
「それ、変なこと思い出しちゃうってこと？　意地悪だよ～」=“Does that mean you remember weird things?　You're being mean.”
「会うたびにちょっと過っちゃうんだって。その、すごく……可愛かったから」=“Every time I see you, I get carried away a little. Um... you were just... so cute.”
「普通にしてただけだよ～」=“I was just being myself~.”
「全然、いつも通りじゃなかったよ。あんな風に……」=“You weren't acting normally at all. It wasn't like that...”
「解説しないでいいから～！」=“You don't gotta explain~!”
「と、とにかく、俺にとってすごく特別で幸せなことだったから……それでつい」=“Anyway, it was a very special and happy occasion for me, so I just...”
「まあ、嫌な思い出になるよりはいいけど～」=“Well, that's better than a bad memory~”
「あの後、身体とか平気だった？」=“Did you feel okay afterwards?”
「だから、普通だってば～」=“I told you everything was normal~”
