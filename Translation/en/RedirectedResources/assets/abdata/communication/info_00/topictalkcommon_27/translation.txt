「やっぱり、海ならではのアクティビティが多いね」=“There really are a ton of sea-related activities here, huh?”
「そうね。きれいな海だもの、利用しない手はないわよね」=“Yeah. It's such a beautiful sea, there's no way you can just ignore it.”
「この島を満喫するとしたら？」=“If you wanted to fully enjoy this island, how would you do it?”
「んー、いろんなアクティビティに挑戦してみるのが手っ取り早いんじゃないかしら？」=“Nn, wouldn't it be the easiest to just try out all the different activities?”
「全部のアクティビティを回り終える頃には体力付いてそうだな……」=“I feel like going through all these activities one by one's gonna need a bunch of stamina...”
「あら、貴重な体験が出来て更に鍛えられるなんて一石二鳥じゃない？」=“Oh? I personally think it's a two birds with one stone deal. You get to enjoy it all and you get you build your body.”
「今はどんな観光やレジャーをしてみたいと思う？」=“What sort of activities or sightseeing do you think you wanna do for now?”
「そうね……んー……ありすぎて一つに絞れないわ……」=“Hmm, let's see... nnn... there's so many I can't pin it down to one...”
「どこへ行っても楽しみがあるって、とてもすごいことだよね」=“It's actually kind amazing how no matter where we go, there's always something to do, isn't it?”
「この島の全てがアクティビティとして成り立ってるわね」=“This entire island is one giant activity paradise, isn't it?”
「やっぱり、するなら二人で出来るアクティビティがいい？」=“Would you rather do something together than by yourself after all?”
「ま、まぁ、あんたがどうしてもしたいって言うなら、考えてあげなくもないわよ……？」=“W-Well, if you really insist on doing something with me, I wouldn't mind giving it a bit of thought, you know...?”
「この島に、どれくらい生き物が生息してるんだろう……」=“I wonder just how many creatures live on this island...”
「ふふっ、もしかして私達が新種を発見しちゃったりするかも？」=“Fufuh--, we might just end up finding a new species or two ourselves. Maybe.”
「今からこの自然の中でサバイバル生活して下さい、って言われたら……？」=“If they told us to drop everything and try to survive off of nature from this moment on, then...?”
「ま、まぁ、私なら余裕で生き残れますけど？」=“W-Well, I'd be able to survive just fine myself, though?”
「ほんと、空気が気持ちいいよねこの島」=“The air really does feel great here, doesn't it?”
「そうね、やっぱり自然が多いからかしら？」=“Yeah, I wonder if it's really all thanks to all the nature?”
「今日はどんな自然に出会えるかな？」=“I wonder what part of nature we'll get to see today?”
「見たことないモノだらけだものね、毎日が新鮮な気分でいられるわ」=“The place is just chock full of things we've never seen before, so everyday feels like a brand new day.”
「ここの自然の力強さにはほんと感嘆するよなぁ」=“The power of nature in on this island is seriously something else, isn't it~”
「そうね……私も、これだけ強く有りたいわ」=“Yeah... I want to be this strong too.”
「こういった自然、いつまでも守り続けられたらいいな……」=“It'd be nice if we could protect slices of nature like this forever...”
「えぇ、私たちも、出来得る限りの努力はしていきましょ？」=“Yes, let's do our best to help out as well, where we can?”
「ほんと、ここの海は綺麗だよね」=“Seriously, this sea's just beautiful, isn't it?”
「ま、まぁ、私はこのくらい綺麗な海なんて見慣れてるけど？」=“W-Well, I'm pretty used to seeing such beautiful seas all the time though?”
「こんな綺麗な海で泳げるなんて、最高だよね！」=“The fact that we get to swim in a sea like this is just the best, isn't it!”
「ちょっと、はしゃぎすぎて溺れないでよね……？」=“Hey, don't go so wild that you drown, okay...?”
「海にいるとやたらラーメンとか焼きそば食べたくならない？」=“Doesn't being out on the beach make you really want ramen and yakisoba for some reason?”
「あ、それちょっとわかる気がするわ……」=“Ah, I feel like I can relate...”
「ここの海でなら、ぷかぷか浮いてるだけで時間があっという間に過ぎちゃいそうだな」=“I feel like you could end up spending a whole day away just floating on the sea and not even notice, you know?”
「……あんた、それ絶対流されるやつだし、やめときなさいよ……？」=“...You know, you really strike me as the type that'd just get carried out to see, so don't do that, okay...?”
「海・水着ときたらエッチなハプニングが――」=“Between the sea and swimsuits, there's a real high chance that something lewd could--”
「な、ないわよ！！」=“T-There isn't, shaddup!!”
「海ときたらどんな遊びが浮かぶ？」=“What sort of thing comes to mind when you think "Fun seaside activity"?”
「うーん……夜に花火、とかかしら……？」=“Nnnn... fireworks at night, I guess...?”
「ご当地名物となると、なかなか特徴的なものが出てくるよね」=“When it comes to local specialities, many of them are pretty darn unique, aren't they?”
「そうね、やっぱりその土地柄を印象づける為かしら……？　」=“Yeah, I wonder if it's to really impress the local uniqueness...?”
「地方限定○○、みたいな食べ物やアクセサリー、この島にもあったりするのかな？」=“You think they have any dishes or accessories or the like, that you can only find here and nowhere else?”
「あるんじゃないかしら？　ああいうのはいろんな地方に展開されてたりするもの」=“Probably, no? You seem them all over the country.”
「ご当地名物と言えば、たまにパッケージからはまったく味の想像つかないやつとかあるよね」=“With the local specialties, sometimes you can't tell at all what it's gonna taste like from the package, can you?”
「そういうの、実際食べてみると案外今まで食べたことのある味だったりもするわよね」=“And when you actually go to try it out, sometimes it tastes surprisingly like something you've had before, doesn't it?”
「この間気づいたんだけど、見たことない調味料が置いてたりするよね」=“I only just realized it the other day but, sometimes they also serve some seasoning on the side to put on your food, don't they? I've never seen it before.”
「あぁ、たまにあるわね……あれ、結構気になってるのよね……」=“Aah, yeah, sometimes... I just keep getting more and more curious about it...”
「こういった南の島って、やたら甘いものが名物になってたりするよね」=“On southern islands like these, it's very common for a lot of the local specialities to be ridiculously sweet, isn't it?”
「そうね、ここもサトウキビ畑があるし……生産のしやすさとかがあるのかしら？」=“Yeah, this place has its sugarcane fields too... I wonder if it's down to it being easier to produce here?”
「ほんと、いろんな名物があるから、どれを買うか迷っちゃうんだよなぁ」=“Seriously, there's so many local specialties, it's hard to pick one to buy, isn't it?”
「別に、気に入ったものを好きなだけ買えばいいのよ。……買ってから置き場に困ったりもするけど」=“Just buy whatever catches your fancy, don't think too much. ...Though then you're gonna have trouble with finding a place to keep it all.”
「やっぱりこういう島ときたらヌーディストビーチだよね！」=“Man, there's gotta be a nudist beach around on an island like this!”
「あんたはどーしてそんなエッチな事ばっか考えてるのよっ」=“Why do you always just think of lewd stuff like that and nothing else--!”
「自然の中で野性味あふれるエッチとか……どう？」=“So, untamed, wild sex in the middle of nature... how about it?”
「どう？　じゃなーーーい！」=“How about it? No way in heeeeeellll!”
「ハブも滋養強壮として重宝されてるらしいよ？」=“Seems like habu snakes are pretty highly prized as performance enhancers, you know?”
「そ、そう…………で、効果はどれだけあるのかしら……？」=“I-I see... so, how effective are they...?”
「ば、馬鹿っ、いきなり何言い出すのよ……っ」=“D-Dummy--, what are you even saying...--!”
「そ、そうやって私をからかおうとしても無駄よ？」=“T-There's no point in trying to tease me like that, you know?”
