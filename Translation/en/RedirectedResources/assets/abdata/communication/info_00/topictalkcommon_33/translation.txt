「ほんと、いろんなアクティビティがあるよね」=“There really are all kinds of things to do here, huh?”
「そうね、ゆったりするものから激しそうなものまで、幅広く楽しめるわね」=“Yeah, from comfy things to intense stuff, you can really go all out here.”
「海のアクティビティと陸のアクティビティ、どっちがいいとかってある？」=“Do you have like a preference, between land or sea activities?”
「うーん、どちらもそれぞれの味あるし、1番は選べないわねぇ」=“Nnnnn, both of them are good in their own way so, it's hard to really pick one, you know~?”
「全部のアクティビティを回ったら体力もたなそうだよなぁ……」=“It feels like we're gonna end up running ourselves ragged if we try to do everything, doesn't it?....”
「ふふっ、焦る必要はないわ。時間はあるんだし、ゆっくり回っていけばいいのよ」=“Fufuh--, there's no need to rush. We've got lots of time here, so just relax and take your time, okay?”
「アクティビティを効率よく回っていくコツってあったりするのかなぁ……」=“I wonder if there's like an optimized plan for doing all the activities here....”
「んー、効率やコツを求めるよりも、いかに１つ１つを楽しめるか、なんじゃないかしら？」=“Nn~, rather than that, isn't it more about enjoying every single activity as much as you can?”
「いろんなアクティビティがある中でも、やっぱり海や水が絡むものが多いね」=“There's a ton of things to do here but, even then most of those have something or other to do with the water, don't they?”
「そうね、こういった島国特有ってことかしらね？」=“Yeah, I wonder if that's just what's normal on an island like this?”
「こういったアクティビティを他でもやれたら、と思うけど……」=“I feel like it'd be pretty nice, if we could do this stuff back home too...”
「でも、この島でするからこその感動があると思うわよ？」=“But, I think the entire reason why they feel special is because we can only do them here, you know?”
「この島の自然、どこまで堪能出来るかなぁ……」=“I wonder how thoroughly we can enjoy the nature here...”
「隅々まで見回るのは流石に大変そうね」=“It does seem like checking out every nook and cranny would be a hassle, doesn't it?”
「これだけの自然があるのって、水質が良かったりとかあるのかな？」=“I wonder if the water here's extra good or something? I mean, there's so much nature around.”
「水含め、環境的にとてもよい条件が揃ってるって事かしらね？」=“It's probably that the entire environment is really quite good, no? Including the water.”
「自然を堪能するには何が一番いいかなぁ」=“I wonder what'd be the best way to enjoy all the nature here?”
「んー、やっぱりどんな事よりも自分の足で、目で、直に触れていくのが一番なんじゃないかしら？」=“Nn~, rather than anything else, wouldn't it be best to use your own feet, your own eyes and feel it for yourself with your own hands?”
「この自然の中で、どれだけの生存競争が行われてるのか……」=“I wonder just how many creatures are fighting for survival, under the wraps of nature here....”
「今も見えないところ、島の奥深くで行われてるかもしれないわね」=“It could even be happening right now, far far away from anywhere we can see.”
「あの自然を維持するのって並みならないことだよなぁ」=“It's probably not an easy task to maintain all this nature, is it?”
「そうね、この島の人の努力の甲斐は大きいと思うわ」=“Yeah, I think the people here put a lot of effort into that.”
「自然と生きるって、こういった島での暮らしの事を言うんだろうなぁ」=“When people say "living with nature", I guess this sort of place is what they're referring to, huh?”
「流石に大げさな気もするけど……でも、近しいのかもしれないわね」=“It does feel a bit like an overexaggeration, doesn't it?... But well, it might be as close as you can realistically get.”
「海での食べ物と言えば？」=“What comes to mind when you think "food at the beach"?”
「そうね……私はかき氷かしら？　冷たくて美味しいのよね」=“Let's see... shaved ice for me? It's so cold and tasty.”
「ここの海や浜辺に固有種とかいたりするのかなぁ」=“I wonder if there's any endemic species in the sea or the beach here?”
「案外、まだ見つかっていない種とかがいたりして？」=“You never know, there might still be some undiscovered ones.”
「これだけ澄んだ海、入らないわけにはいかないよなぁ」=“With how clear the sea here is, there's just no way to resist taking a dip, is there?”
「えぇ、気持ちよさも格別だと思うわ」=“Yes, it feels extra nice too.”
「夜の海って、明かりがないと全てを飲み込んでしまいそうだよね……」=“At night, in the darkness, it really does feel like the sea's just swallowing everything up, doesn't it?”
「えぇ。だから夜の海に近づくときは気を付けて頂戴ね？」=“Yes. Make sure to be careful when you walk to the beach at night because of that, okay? For me.”
「いつか海の上を歩けたりするのかなぁ」=“I wonder if we'll ever be able to walk on water?”
「そうねぇ、いつになるかはわからないけど、それもまた夢のある話ね」=“Yeah~, who knows when it'll be, it'd be a dream come true though.”
「ほんと、こんな綺麗な海がある場所に来れるなんて思わなかったよ」=“Seriously, I never thought I'd ever come to a place with a sea this beautiful.”
「そうね、実際この目で見るまではなかなか信じられなかったわね」=“Yeah, it's not something you can even believe exists before you see it with your own eyes, isn't it?”
「こういった所の名産品と言えば、お守りや呪い的なグッズだよね」=“When you think about the local specialties of places like these, what comes to mind are things like charms and curse items, isn't it?”
「特に木彫りで作られてるものってそういうものが多いわよね」=“Especially stuff carved out of wood and the like, things like that really tend to be of that nature, don't they?”
「この島の名物と言われてるところ、全部回っておきたいなぁ」=“I wanna check out every single famous place on this island, atleast once~”
「折角来たなら、そういった所は隅々まで見て体験していきたいわよね」=“Of course, we came all the way here, so it'd be nice to experience every single thing this island has to offer, wouldn't it?”
「小さな島ではあるけど、結構いろんな名産品があるよね」=“For a small island like this, there sure is a lot to do around here.”
「そうね、それぞれがしっかり島の特徴を表してると思うわ」=“Yeah, and I think each and every one of those activities has something to say about what this island's about.”
「こう、目で見るものだけじゃなく、波や木々とか自然の音も名物として成り立ってる感じするよね」=“It's like, it's not all just what you see with your eyes, but even stuff like the sound of the waves or the tress that make up what's so good about this place, isn't it?”
「ふふっ、この島の全てが名物ってところかしら？」=“Fufuh--, are you saying that everything about this island's what's good about this island?”
「こういう所の食べ物や飲み物って極端に甘かったりすっぱかったりするよね」=“The food and drinks in places like these tend to be very extreme, don't they? Extremely sweet, extremely sour, and whatnot.”
「あれは何でなのかしらね？　不思議だわ」=“I know, I wonder why? It's a mystery.”
「どれか一つでも、この島の名産品は持って帰りたいなぁ」=“It'd be nice to take any single local speciality from here home, wouldn't it?”
「島を離れる前のお土産屋、忘れずに行かないとね？」=“We'll have to make sure to hit up the gift shop before we leave, definitely.”
「この島独特のエッチな物事ってあったりするのかな……」=“I wonder if there's any lewd things to do here that are unique to this place....”
「あら、それを調べてどうする気かしら？　勿論、私で試してくれるのよね……？」=“Oh my, and what will you do with that information? You'll come to me and nobody else, right...?”
「こう、エッチなアクティビティとかあるとしたらどんなのがいい？」=“So like, if there were any lewd activities on this land, what kind would you like?”
「そうねぇ、普段出来ないようなもの……蔦に絡まったりとかかしら……？」=“Let's see~, something we can't do normally... stuff like maybe bondage with vines...?”
「見晴らしのいい場所でエッチなんてしたりして……」=“Imagine if we had sex somewhere with an open view...”
「ふふっ、野性的で開放的で……嫌いじゃないわよ？」=“Fufuh--, that'd be pretty wild and liberating... I wouldn't mind it, you know?”
「あら、そういう話をするのはまだ早いんじゃないかしら？」=“Oh my, isn't it a bit too early for us to be talking about that stuff?”
「こーら、エッチな事言わないの」=“Hey~, no lewd stuff, bad boy.”
