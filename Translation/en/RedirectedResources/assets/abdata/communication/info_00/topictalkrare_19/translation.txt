「ホエールウォッチングって興味ある？」=“Got any interest in whale watching?”
「あるけど……どちらかといったら、見るより背中に乗ってみたいかも」=“I do but... if I really had to say, I'm more interested in riding on the back of one, than watching one.”
「……ちょっと子供っぽいかな？」=“...Maybe that's a bit childish?”
「そうは思わないけど」=“I don't think so, not at all.”
「子供の頃に読んだ児童書が印象に残ってて。クジラと海を旅するの」=“You see, a book I read as a child left a big impression on me. It was about going on a sea voyage with a whale.”
「あはは、そんなところだと思ったよ」=“Ahahah, I knew it had to be something like that.”
「ヤシガニが今よりもっと大きくなったら怖いと思わない？」=“Don't you think coconut crabs would be pretty darn scary if they got any bigger than they are now?”
「ホラー小説の世界だね。ヤシガニは雑食で、なんでも食べるから……」=“That'd be straight out of horror. Especially since they're omnivores, and can eat anything...”
「ご、ごめんなさい……ちょっと、想像が育ちすぎちゃったたかも」=“I-I'm sorry... I think my imagination got the better of me there.”
「こっちこそごめん。か、顔色悪いよ？」=“I'm sorry myself. Y-Your face's looking pretty pale, you know?”
「……動きは鈍いから。ああ、でも、防御力が高そう……」=“...They are pretty slow, after all. Aah, but, they're built like tanks...”
（想像力が止まらなくなってる……）=(Her train of thought isn't stopping at all...)
「月桃っていい匂いするよね」=“Shell gingers smell very nice, don't they?”
「うん……私、月桃って名前も好きなの」=“Yeah... I really like that name too.”
「言われてみればキレイな響きだね」=“Now that you say it, it does have a nice ring to it.”
「花が桃みたいっていうのが名前の由来らしいけど……月はどこからきたんだろう」=“Seems like they're named that way because they're related to gingers but... I wonder why they're called shells.”
「……色？」=“...The color?”
「月夜に映えるから、とかかも。……そうやって色々想像すると楽しいね」=“It might be, that they kinda look like sea shells. ...It's pretty fun, to think about stuff like this, isn't it?”
「ヤマネコってちょっと格好いいよね」=“Wildcats are pretty cool, aren't they?”
「確かに……可愛いよりは格好いいの方が似合うかも」=“For sure... rather than "cute", "cool" might fit them better.”
「シャーっていいそう」=“You can almost hear one hissing.”
「……シャーは、本当はなんて言ってるのかな？」=“...I wonder what they mean, when they do that?”
「それは、猫じゃないのでなんとも」=“Only another cat could tell you.”
「おなか空いたー、とかかな？　何見てんだよ……とかかも」=“Wonder if it's like, "I'm hungry~"? Or maybe... "the heck you looking at!", or whatever.”
「動物と人間が普通にお話がしてる小説とか読むと、いつも羨ましいなあって思うの」=“Whenever I read a book that has people and animals talking to each other, I always feel a bit jealous.”
「動物と話してみたい？」=“You want to talk to animals?”
「うん、きっと何気ない彼らの日常の話ですら、すごく楽しいはずだから」=“Yep, since even their casual everyday stories, are bound to be tons of fun.”
「ヤマネコのノンフィクションならなおさらかもね」=“Especially if they're the real life accounts of an actual wildcat, too.”
「流れ星っていったら、やっぱりお願い事かな？」=“I guess shooting stars bring making a wish to mind?”
「うん、そうだね。私も夜空に流れ星を見つけたら、お願い事を口にしちゃうと思う」=“Yeah, they do. If I saw a shooting star crossing the sky, I'd probably end up making a wish too.”
「へえ、お願い事があるんだ。どんな？」=“Hoh, so you've got one. What sort?”
「……近所の本屋がいつまでも閉店しませんように、かな」=“..."Please never let the neighbourhood bookstore close", I guess.”
「思ってたの違うのが来た」=“That's one I didn't expect.”
「最近、本屋さんは大変だっていうから。いつも心配なの」=“It's been a really trying time for bookstores lately, apparently. So I'm always worried.”
「切実だね……」=“You're very serious, huh...”
「……いっそ、潰れない本屋さんを経営したいですの方がいいかな」=“...Or maybe, if I'm wishing for something, maybe I should wish to become a manager at a bookstore that would never close down.”
「どっちであっても流れ星を困らせそうだね」=“Whichever it is, seems like the stars are gonna have a hard time either way.”
「サガリバナって不思議だよね」=“Mango pines are incredible, aren't they?”
「一晩だけ咲く花……うん、とっても神秘的」=“Flowers that only bloom for a single night... yeah, they're very mystical.”
「その夜のうちに散ることがわかっていても……やっぱり、花は咲きたいのかな」=“Even knowing that they'll wilt and die in the same night... do you think they would still want to bloom anyway?”
「もし、花に心があるなら咲くことがゴールなんだろうから、咲きたいと思うよ」=“If flowers had souls, I imagine their goal would be to bloom, so I think they would, yeah.”
「私もそう思う。懸命に咲くのね、命の証を立てるために」=“I think so too. They'd still bloom earnestly, to prove that they once lived.”
「こんな話の後でもし、サガリバナを見たら悲しい気持ちになりそう」=“If I see one anytime soon, I think it's gonna put me in a real sad mood.”
「そうだね。健気に咲いてる姿を見たら、私も泣いちゃうかも……」=“Yeah. If I saw one in a full proud bloom, I think I might just end up crying...”
「最近、気にしてた鳥の巣があるんだけど、この前雛が孵ってたよ」=“I've been watching over this birds nest for a bit now, and the egg in it finally hatched.”
「本当？　……気軽に触ったりしてない？」=“Really? ...You didn't go and touch the birdie, right?”
「別にいじったりはしてないけど」=“I'm not that much of a careless guy.”
「よかった。人間の匂いがつくと仲間や親に嫌われることがある、って見たから」=“Great. I've read before, that if they get the smell of humans on them, they can get shunned by their peers and even their parents.”
「優しいんだね」=“You're very kind, you know.”
「……そういうのじゃないの。ごめんなさい、つまらないこと言って」=“...It's not that. I'm sorry, I ended up saying something so silly.”
「照れなくても」=“You don't need to blush.”
「照れてるんじゃなくて。私すぐ頭でっかちなこと言っちゃうから……」=“I'm not blushing. It's just me and my big head, always making my big mouth run...”
（完全に照れてる……）=(She's blushing ear to ear...)
「この前、育ててた庭のアサガオが花をつけたんだ」=“The other day, this morning glory in the yard that I've been watering finally bloomed.”
「庭って……民宿の？　そんなことしてたんだね」=“The yard... at the boarding house? You've been doing that, huh?”
「なんか気になっちゃって」=“Yeah, I just couldn't help myself.”
「そっか……夏は植物の成長が早いから、意外とすぐ咲いたのかな」=“I see... plants grow much faster in summer so, maybe that's why it bloomed so quickly.”
「かな？　俺もびっくりしたよ」=“Maybe? It really caught me off guard.”
「……観察日誌とか書いてない？　あったら読んでみたい」=“...Did you make an observation diary to go along with it? I'd love to read it if you did.”
「つけてないよ。普通に水やったりしてただけだし」=“Nah, I didn't. I was just watering it out of boredom more than anything else.”
「残念……読めたら面白そうだったんだけど……」=“Shame... It'd have been a really interesting read, to me atleast...”
（文字に対する執念がすごいな……）=(Her thirst for things to read is seriously amazing...)
「マンタが主役の小説とかあるのかな」=“I wonder if there's novels out there with mantas as the main characters?”
「主役？　ちょっとした役で出てくるお話なら……ええと」=“The main characters? If you're fine with stories with them having a minor role... erhm.”
「……ごめんなさい。それすら思い浮かばないかな」=“...I'm sorry. Those are the only ones I can think of.”
「じゃあ、二人で設定を考えてみようか？　まん太郎の大冒険」=“Then, how about we think of a setting together? With "The Great Adventures of Mantarou" as a basis.”
「もうちょっと、名前を凝った方がいいと思うけど……」=“I really think you should think of a better name first though...”
「手厳しい」=“Harsh.”
「海ほたるって昔の人はなんだと思ってたのかな？」=“I wonder what people from the old days thought all the sea fireflies were?”
「あ……面白い着眼点だね。うーん……多分、奇跡みたいに思ったのかも」=“Ah... that's an interesting question. Nnn... probably, a miracle of some sort.”
「夜の海で、あんなに無数の光がピカピカしてるんだもんね」=“Wouldn't surprise me, you see so many of them glowing brightly at night.”
「……連想しそうなものだと、やっぱり魂とか？」=“...Maybe souls, or something? That's what comes to mind.”
「実はもう広まってる妖怪の中に、案外、正体が海ほたるのものとかあったりして」=“Actually, amongst all the youkai that people know of, surprisingly many could be pegged to sea fireflies or similar.”
「それはちょっと味気ないかも……正体なんてわからないままでいいのかな」=“I dunno about that... is it really okay that we don't know what they actually are?”
「ウミガメってどんなイメージがある？」=“What sort of image do you have of sea turtles?”
「……小説を絡めていいなら……賢いイメージかな？」=“...If you don't mind me referencing novels... I guess a wise one?”
「確かに、長老っぽいイメージあるかも」=“I can see it, they do kinda have this senior sort of image.”
「長生きだからついたイメージなんだろうね」=“I imagine they got it because they live so long.”
「顔もおじいちゃんっぽいし」=“They also look like actual seniors too, that probably helps.”
「くすくす。そう言われると、亀はみんなおじいちゃん顔かも……」=“*Giggle*. Now that you say it, they all kinda do...”
「ウミガメに会ったら知恵を授けてもらおうか？」=“Shall we have it bestow knowledge upon us, if we come across one?”
「竜宮城の場所でも聞くの？　ロマンチックだね」=“Gonna ask it where the dragon king's palace is? How romantic.”
「そういえば、お土産で星の砂が売ってたよ」=“Reminds me, I saw them selling starsand at the souvenir shop.”
「……幸運のお守り、だっけ？」=“...A lucky charm, was it?”
「みたいだね。なんか、色んな種類があったなぁ」=“Seems like it, yeah. They had all kinds too.”
「中は同じじゃないの？　……もしかして、彩色とかしてるのかな……？」=“They weren't all the same? ...Maybe they dye them differently...?”
「多分、そうかも。加工してるとご利益薄かったりするのかな？」=“That might be just it. You think the "charm" bit would be less effective with the processed ones?”
「うーん……逆に、誰かの想いがこもってる分、ご利益があるかも……」=“Nnnn... if anything, since someone worked on them personally, and packed it full of their feelings, they might be more effective...”
「ウムイの鐘のジンクスって信じる？」=“Do you believe in the legend of the Bell of Umuy?”
「私も女の子だから……占いとかそういうのは気になるし、信じるよ」=“I'm a girl too so... I can't help believing in that sort of stuff, so I believe in that too.”
「信じるものは救われる、みたいなこともあるし……」=“You do hear it a lot too, how those who believe will be saved and all...”
「言われてみれば、信じる信じないも自分自身の判断だしね」=“Now that you say it, believing in it or not is entirely up to you, isn't it?”
「うん……二人で信じれば、その信じる気持ちがそのまま未来になるんだよ」=“Yeah... if both people believe it, that feeling will carry them both into the future together.”
「なるほど。誓いみたいなものか」=“I see. So I suppose it's more a vow than anything else.”
「おっぱいって、どういう呼び方が一番エッチだと思う？」=“What do you think, is the lewdest way to say "boobs"?”
「い、色んな呼び方があるからね……男の人次第なんじゃないかな」=“T-There's all sorts of words so... wouldn't that depend upon the man saying it?”
「乳、乳房、ボイン、パイオツ、お胸、バスト……」=“Breasts, udders, boing-boings, tits, chest, bust...”
「官能小説では、果実とか……も、もう少し、文学っぽい呼び方したりもするね」=“In erotic fiction, I've seen "fruits" and... i-in general, they use a bit more tasteful words, you know?”
「甘くて芳しいからか」=“Fruits, huh? Wonder if it's because they're sweet and smell great.”
「わ、私の胸を見ながらそういうこと言わないで……？」=“C-Could you not say that while looking at my chest...?”
「本の匂いフェチってあるよね？」=“There's book smell fetishes and whatnot out there too, right?”
「フェチというか……その……図書館の匂いが好き、みたいなことだよね？」=“I don't think it's a fetish... it's uhm... more just liking the smell of a library, no?”
「本の匂いを嗅ぐとむらむらする、みたいなことでもある」=“But there's people who get aroused when they smell books.”
「そ、それだと変な人だよ」=“I-I think those people are just freaks.”
「なくもないと思うけど。本と女の子の組み合わせは背徳的で……」=“I don't think they're that uncommon though. The combination of girls and books is just so immoral and...”
「エッチなの……？　本を読んでると男の子にそんな目で見られちゃうんだ……」=“Lewd...? So that's how you seem me when I read a book, huh...”
「本を読んでて欲求不満になることってないの？」=“Do you never feel sexually frustrated when you read books?”
「わ、私、官能小説ばかり読んでるわけじゃないけど……」=“I-It's not like I read erotica all the time...”
「で、でも……のめり込んでる本でそういうシーンか出てきたら……感情移入しちゃう、かも……」=“B-But... if a book I'm really absorbed into has a scene like that... I think I do, self insert a bit...”
「やっぱり、ムラムラすることはあるんだ」=“So you do feel horny, huh?”
「ムラムラって言わないで！　少しだけ、あ、あそこが熱くなったりするくらいで」=“Don't use that word! It just makes me, a-a bit hot down there, that's all.”
（そこまでいったら充分なのでは……）=(Is that not enough by itself...?)
「なんだかさ？　思い出しちゃうね。この前のこと」=“Man. It's hard to not think about it, isn't it? About when we did i.t”
「うん……私も同じ。本当のこと言うと、まっすぐあなたを見られないくらい」=“Yeah... it really is. If I'm being honest, I can't even look at you straight.”
「あなたの指も、唇も、全部……私にとって特別になっちゃったから」=“Your fingers, your lips, your everything... it's all become so special to me.”
「意識しすぎるってこと？　同じだよ」=“You mean you're overly conscious of it? Me too.”
「そう、だよね。エッチってそういうの全部分けあうものだもの……」=“Of, course. Afterall, sex is all about sharing all of those feelings with each other so...”
「……すごく可愛かった」=“...You were seriously adorable.”
「い、今、あの時のこと思い出してるの？　ダメだよ。意識したら私まで……」=“A-Are you, thinking back to it right now? Don't, stop it. You're gonna make me do it too...”
「もう、エッチ……」=“Jeez, you lewdie...”
