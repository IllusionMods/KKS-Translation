「なにか気になるレジャーはあった？」=“Any activity that caught your eye here?”
「ええ、あり過ぎて困ってるぐらい。研修を忘れないように気をつけながら、私も遊んでみるつもりよ」=“Yes, so many, it's almost too many. I'll try having some fun too, of course, without forgetting our studies.”
「運動は得意な方なの？」=“Are you good at physical stuff?”
「ちょっとどんくさいと思われることがあるんだけど、これでも意外と動けるのよ？　ふふっ」=“I have a pretty clumsy side to myself but, I can move when I want to, you know? Fufuh--”
「温かいから、歩いてるだけで汗がめっちゃ出ちゃうよ」=“It's so hot here, just moving around makes me drenched in sweat.”
「まぁ、大変！　私が拭いてあげましょうか？」=“Oh my, we can't have that! Want me to wipe it off for you?”
「遊べるところがいっぱいあるから、運動不足に困ることはなさそうだね」=“There's so many things to do here, we're certainly not gonna end up with a lack of exercise, that's for sure, huh?”
「ふふっ、そうね～。でも遊ぶのに夢中になり過ぎちゃダメよ？　しっかり休憩をとってね」=“Fufuh--, yeah~. But don't get too absorbed into doing things, okay? Proper rest is important too.”
「二人で出来るアクティビティって、なにがあるかな？」=“I wonder what sort of two person activities they have here?”
「あら、もしかしてひとりでやってみるのが怖いの？　うふふ、可愛いわね♪」=“My, are you scared of doing them all by your lonesome? Ufufuh, so adorable♪”
「もっと体力をつけたいと思ってんだよね」=“I was just thinking that I needed to put on some more stamina, you know?”
「ふふっ、あなたが今以上に元気になったら、お世話をするのが大変そうね。でも良いことだと思うわ♪」=“Fufuh--, if you get any more energetic, I have a hunch it's going to become a real battle to keep taking care of you. But I think being energetic is good♪”
「当たり前のことだけど、島全体が南国って感じがするよね」=“I know I'm stating the obvious but, the entire island feels like, just a "southern country", doesn't it?”
「うふふ、わかるわ。島の人も動物も自然も……南国って感じよね」=“Ufufuh, I feel you. The people here, the animals, the nature in general... it all feels like a southern country.”
「木々のさざめきを聞いてると、なんだか眠くなってくるんだよね」=“Just listening to the rustling of trees kinda makes you feel all sleepy, doesn't it?”
「うふふ、本当に眠たくなったら言ってね。子守唄をうたってあげるわ」=“Ufufuh, if you really feel like taking a nap, let me know, okay? I'll sing you a lullaby.”
「この島にしか住んでない虫とかいるのかな？」=“You think there's any bugs that can only be found on this island?”
「どう、かしら？　……正直なことを言っちゃうと、いたとしてもあんまり出会いたくないわ～」=“I, wonder? ...Honestly speaking, even if there are, I don't want to come across any~”
「森林浴って気持ちがいいよね」=“Nature walks feel really nice, don't they?”
「わかるわ～。空気が気持ち良くて、小鳥さんのさえずりが聞こえてきて……すっごくリラックスできるわよね」=“I feel you~. The air feels so good, and with the chirping of all the birds too... it's just incredibly relaxing, isn't it?”
「この島でも、自然を保護する活動は行われてるみたいだね」=“Seems like even on this island, they have some nature preservation efforts going on, huh?”
「私たちにもお手伝いできることがあれば、積極的にやっていきましょうか」=“Let's join in ourselves proactively too, if there's anything we can help with, shall we?”
「老後はこういう自然豊かな所で暮らしたいかも……」=“I think I wanna retire in a nature filled place like this...”
「あらあら、もうそんな先のことまで考えているの？　ふふっ、あなたはえらいわね～」=“Oh my, are you already thinking that far ahead? Fufuh--, that's so commendable~”
「やっぱり、この辺りには珍しい魚がたくさんいるんだろうね」=“This island probably has a lot of unique marine life around it, doesn't it?”
「水族館の水槽もとってもカラフルだったから、きっとそうね～。どんな子がいるのか、もっと出会ってみたいわ」=“Even the aquarium had such colorful varieties, so I'm sure it does~. I wanna see each and every one of them, atleast once.”
「海もだけど、砂浜もすごく綺麗だよね」=“The sea's of course pretty but, the beaches are great too, aren't they?”
「うんうん、分かるわ～。太陽に照らされた青い海と白い砂浜を初めてみたとき、しばらく見惚れちゃったもの」=“Yepyep, I feel you~. The first time I saw the blue sea and the glittering beach under the sunlight, I actually couldn't take my eyes off it for a bit.”
「深海魚って、可愛いと思う？」=“Do you think deep sea fishes are cute?”
「キュートな見た目をしてると思うわ♪　飼うのは難しいみたいだから残念ね～」=“I do think they're pretty darn adorable♪ It's a shame too, since apparently they're pretty hard to care for~”
「海の生き物の中だと、なにが一番好き？」=“Out of all the sea creatures, which do you like the most?”
「うーん、一番を決めなきゃいけないのね～……どの子も可愛いから難しいわ」=“Nnn, you're going to make me pick one, huh~... it's pretty hard, they're all so cute.”
「この島でも、海水から塩を作ってるのかな？」=“You think they make salt here too, from sea water?”
「近くの島では盛んに作られてるみたいよ～。ブランド化されてるから、ここでも販売していたわ」=“Seems like they love doing it on the next island over~. It's branded too so, they sell it here as well.”
「魚を見て可愛いと思う？　それとも美味しそうと思う？」=“When you look at fish, do you think "cute"? Or do you think "looks tasty"?”
「可愛いとは思うけど……やっぱり調理の仕方を想像しちゃうかも。どんな風にしたら美味しいんだろう……とかね」=“I do think "cute" but... I think I just can't help but imagine how you'd prepare them. You know, how to process them to make them as delicious as possible... and whatnot.”
「食べただけで、料理の味を再現出来たりする？　出来るなら、島の料理を作ってみてほしいなぁ」=“Can you recreate a flavour, from just eating a dish once? If you can, I'd love it if you could try making some local dishes~”
「ごめんね、使ってる調味料は分かっても、再現は難しいの。でもメニューを教えてもらえたら、できるかもしれないわ」=“I'm sorry, even if I figure out what seasonings they're using, it's hard to recreate a dish. But I might be able to do it, if I get the recipe off them.”
「自販機で売られてる飲み物も、なんか珍しいものばっかりだよね」=“Even the vending machines are all kinda filled with drinks you'd never find back in the city, aren't they?”
「気になったから色々買ってみたんだけど、どれも美味しかったわ♪　きっとあなたも気に入るはずよ」=“I got curious so I tried a bunch of them, and they all turned out to be delicious♪ I'm sure you'd like them too.”
「こっちのお菓子は食べてみた？」=“Have you tried any of the local sweets yet?”
「紅芋味のおやつを買ってみたわ。たくさんあるから、今度一緒に食べる？」=“I've tried some of the purple yam flavoured ones. There's lots and lots of them though, so want to try them together next time?”
「来る前は全然知らなかったけど、色んな工芸品があるんだね」=“I never knew before we came here but, there's a surprisingly thriving handicrafts industry here, huh?”
「私も事前に読んだガイドブックで初めて知ったわ。写真で見ても素敵だったけど、やっぱり実際に見た方がもっと素敵ね～」=“I also only got to learn about that from the guidebook they gave us, just before we got here. They looked wonderful in the pictures too, of course but, they're even more wonderful in person, aren't they~”
「色んな名産品があるから、何を人に贈るか迷うよね」=“There's so many local goods here, it's hard to decide what to buy for someone, isn't it?”
「お買い物をしてると、どんどん目移りしちゃうわよね～。気が付いたらかごの中がパンパンになってるの」=“You just can't help but get distracted by one thing after another when out shopping, can you~? My cart always gets full before I realize it.”
「女の子が喜びそうな可愛い名産品も売られてるよね」=“They sell a whole lot of cute stuff that girls would just love too, don't they?”
「そうなの～！　すっかり心を奪われちゃったんだけど、ちょっとお値段が……残念だわ～」=“They really do~! It all seriously stole my heart, but the price was a bit... it's such a shame~”
「オナニーの時は、どこを弄るの？」=“When you masturbate, where do you touch yourself?”
「やっぱりクリちゃんを弄ることが多いわね」=“Has to be my little clit, I go for it more often than anything else.”
「エッチなおもちゃって持ってるの？」=“You got any lewd toys?”
「ううん、でも調べてみたことはあるわ。正直に言うと、ちょっと興味があるの」=“Nope, but I have looked into them before. If I'm being honest, I am a little bit interested.”
「実は母乳が出たりしない？」=“You sure you don't make any milk?”
「もう……私の初めての人があなたなのは知ってるでしょ？　赤ちゃんがいないんだから、出たりしないわ」=“Jeez... you already know that you were my first, no? I haven't had any babies yet, so there's no way I could make any.”
「そういうお話は、あなたにはまだ早いわ」=“You're still a bit too young for those sort of talks.”
「エッチなお話をしてくるなんて……背伸びをしてるのかしら」=“To think you'd try to talk about such lewd things... are you trying to act precocious?”
