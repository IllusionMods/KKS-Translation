「下着、キミに見せるとは思わなったからテキトーで……見ちゃダメ」=“I wasn't expecting you to see my underwear, so I'm just going to be random and not look at .......”
「こらーっ。私はいいけど他の子は見ちゃダメぇ！　鼻の下伸ばすなーっ」=“Oh, come on. I don't mind, but the other girls can't see it!　Don't get your nose in the air.”
「もう、私の水着姿を見たがるなんてキミぐらいだよ？　嬉しいけど」=“You're the only one who wants to see me in a bathing suit.　I'm flattered.”
「他の子と私の身体を見比べないの。今の私で満足してほしいの」=“Don't compare my body to other girls. I want you to be happy with me the way I am.”

「この島で何が一番印象に残ってる？」=“What do you remember most about this island?”
「やっぱり海かなぁ……どこまでも青くって空と一緒になったような海だよ」=“The ocean. ...... It's so blue, it's like the sky.”
「ん～っと……キミと恋人同士になれた事、かな、えへへ」=“...... Being in love with you, hehehe.”
「将来の夢とかある？」=“Do you have any dreams for the future?”
「ちょっとベタだけど、やっぱりお嫁さんかな、えへへ」=“It's a bit of a stretch, but I think I'd like to be a wife.”

「普通それ聞く？　も～、私にだけだからね？　ちょっと重め、かな？」=“Do you usually ask that?　Oh, it's only for me, okay?　It's a little heavy, isn't it?”
「心配してくれてるって無理やり解釈するね？　あと教えません」=“I'm gonna force myself to think you're worried about me.　I won't tell you.”
「え、えっとぉ……うん。なんか、他のどこよりゾクッとしちゃう感じ？」=“I'm not going to tell you. - Well, let's see, ....... Does it give you the creeps more than the others?”
「言わない～。あっコラ、何その言わないってことは～？　みたいな顔！」=“I won't tell you. What do you mean you won't tell me?　What do you mean you're not telling me?”

「も、もう……彼女に話すことじゃないと思うな……」=“I don't think that's ...... something you should talk to her about anymore.”
「……うふふ、なあに？」=“...... What is it?”
「もう、見すぎだよ～。ちょっと髪の毛直させて」=“You've been watching too much. Let me fix my hair.”
「何度も見たいって思ってくれるのは嬉しいけど、さすがに照れちゃうから」=“It's nice that you want to see it again and again, but it's embarrassing.”
「そんなに物欲しそうな目で見ても、何も出ないよ？　母乳？　ばか」=“I'm glad you want to see it again and again, but it's embarrassing.　Breast milk?　Nonsense.”
「お話する時間がなくなっちゃうよ。おっぱい見ながらでいいから話そ？」=“I don't have time to talk to you. Can we just talk while I look at your tits?”
「はぁ。もう好きなだけ見てて。私は何か別のことしてるから」=“Huh. Look at them all you want. I'll be doing something else.”
「仲良しするのはキミが謝ってくれたら。ね？　これで謝れるでしょ？」=“I'll only make out with you if you apologize. See?　That's an apology, right?”
「あっ……いきなりなんだから。私、キミの手を握り返してばっかりだね」=“Oh, ......, you're so abrupt. I've been holding your hand all day.”
「エッチしたから手ぐらいって思ってる？　同じぐらい恥ずかしいんだよ？」=“You think I'm just holding your hand because we had sex?　It's just as embarrassing.”
「もうダメ、禁止。これ以上したら、私の手が真っ赤っかになっちゃう」=“No more, no more. If you keep doing that, my hands will turn red.”
「んっ……ここで触らなくても……もう、ちょっとだけだよ？」=“Mmm. ...... You don't have to touch me here. ...... Just a little more, okay?”
「こらぁ、誰かが見てるかもしれないからダメ……んっ。エッチなんだから」=“Come on, someone might be watching. ...... Hmm. I'm being naughty.”

「な、なんか、撫でられすぎて目が回ってきた……そろそろやめてー」=“I'm starting to get dizzy from all the stroking. ...... It's time to stop.”
「あ……ん……ん？　チューするんじゃないの？」=“I'm getting dizzy from all the petting.　Aren't you supposed to kiss me?”
「またほっぺ……チューしないんでしょ？　ほしくなるから、やめてー」=“You're not going to ...... kiss my cheeks again, are you?　You're not going to kiss me again, are you?”
「あーん、ひどいよぉ……チューして、ねえ……笑わないでよ～」=“Oh, my God, ...... kiss me, don't ...... laugh at me.”
「仲直りしたキミとだったら、たくさんしたいな、そういうこと」=“I'd like to do a lot of that with you now that we've made up.”
「付き合ってからもっとキミが好きになっちゃった。ずっと一緒にいてね」=“I like you more now that we're together. I want you to stay with me.”
「キミと話してたら、暑くなってきちゃった。服、脱いじゃおうかなぁ？」=“I'm getting hotter talking to you. I think I'll take off my clothes.”
「ねえ、もっと色んなお喋りしよ。もっとキミのこと知りたいから」=“Hey, let's talk about more things. I want to get to know you better.”
「ゆっくり考えていいよ。キミとなら沈黙もイヤじゃないから……」=“You can take your time. I don't mind silence with you. ......”
「ねえ、何か言って。そうじゃないと私……」=“Come on, say something. Otherwise, I'm ......”
「ごめん、ちょっとの間だけ、距離を置こうか。バイバイ」=“I'm sorry, but I'm going to keep my distance for a while. Bye-bye.”
「私、怒ってるというより、悲しいよ。今はあんまり話したくない。それじゃ」=“I'm more sad than angry. I don't really want to talk right now. Bye.”
「どうして楽しい時間ほど、はやく過ぎちゃうんだろうね……またお話しよ？　バイバイ」=“I don't know why the good times go by so fast. ...... Let's talk again.　Bye.”
「ねえ、次はちゃんと気づいてね？　キミのせいでこうなったんだから」=“Hey, next time you notice me, okay?　It's your fault I'm in this mess.”
「またお話しようね？　絶対だからね？」=“Let's talk again, okay?　I promise, okay?”
「もう時間が来ちゃった。またお話ししようね」=“It's time to go. I'll talk to you later.”
「ごめんね、時間になっちゃった。また一緒にお話ししようね」=“I'm sorry, it's time to go. I'll talk to you later.”
「そっかぁ。キミとはいっぱいお喋りしたいことあるから、また沢山喋ろうね」=“Okay. I've got a lot to talk about with you, so let's talk a lot.”
「うん、またね！　バイバーイ！」=“Yeah, see you!　Bye, bye!”
「もう、直球なんだから……イヤじゃないけどね。それじゃ、しよ？」=“I don't mind that you're being so direct, ....... So, let's do it.”
「う～ん、どうしよっかなぁ……今は、やめとくね」=“Hmm, I don't know. ...... I'm not going to do it right now.”
「あのね、嫌いにならないでほしいんだけど、え、Hしたい、なぁって」=“You know, I don't want you to hate me, but I think I want to have sex with you.”
「よ、よかったぁ。私から誘うのってはしたないかなって。本当に、嬉しい」=“That's good. I didn't think it was appropriate for me to ask you out. I'm really glad.”
「いつもキミがガツガツしてるのにこんなときだけお預け？　やぁん」=“You're always the one being pushy, and this is the only time you're not?　Yuck.”
「もう……変態カップルって噂されちゃうよ？　私は別にいいけどぉ♪」=“We're going to be known as the ...... perverted couple.　I don't mind.”
「キミのことはよくわかってるから驚かないけど、さすがにダーメ」=“I know you well enough to know you're not surprised, but you're a dame.”
「えっ、ここで？　でも、もし友達が来ちゃったら……すごく興奮するかも」=“What, here?　But if my friends came here, I'd be ...... very excited.”

「もちろん、ＯＫだよ。観光、楽しみだね」=“Of course you can. I'm looking forward to seeing the sights.”
「ねぇ、二人でどこか観光しない？」=“Hey, do you want to go sightseeing with me?”
「そうこなくっちゃ。何を見に行こうか？」=“That's what I'm talking about. What should we go see?”
