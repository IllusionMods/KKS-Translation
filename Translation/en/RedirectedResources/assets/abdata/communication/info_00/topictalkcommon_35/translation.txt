「気になるアクティビティとかってある？」=“Is there any activity that's caught your eye here?”
「んー、どれもこれも、みーんな気になるけん」=“Nn~, they've all caught my eye.”
「やっぱこの島に来たからには全部のアクティビティ回りたいよね」=“Since we've come all this way, it makes you wanna do all the things here atleast once, right?”
「うん、全部やってたらめっちゃ体力付きそうやなぁ……」=“Yep, feels like that'd take a ton of stamina though, doesn't it...”
「ここのアクティビティって、ほんと自然をうまいこと使ってるよね」=“The activities here really put all the nature here to good use, don't they?”
「まぁそれこそがアクティビティってことなんやない？」=“Well, isn't that what those activities are all about?”
「もし自分オリジナルのアクティビティを作るとしたらどんなのが浮かぶ？」=“If you could set up and run an activity of your own making, what sorta thing would you go for?”
「うーん、そう簡単には浮かばんねぇ、すでに色々あるけん……」=“Nnnn, it's hard to come up with something on the spot, especially when there's so many things here already...”
「アクティビティ、やっぱ見るのと実際にやるのじゃ全然感じ方が違うよね」=“Just watching stuff and actually doing it feels completely different, doesn't it?”
「流石に比べもんにならんね、まだやったことない人には是非ともやってほしかー」=“They're not even remotely comparable, I definitely want people who've never done any of this to give it a try~”
「この島の良さを知るためにも、いろんなアクティビティに挑戦しないとね」=“We gotta try out all sorts of activities here, don't we? If only to understand the value of this place.”
「そうやね、文字通り身をもって知ることが出来るけんね」=“Yeah, nothing beats actual proper firsthand experience, afterall.”
「自然の中での暮らし、かぁ……」=“Living within nature, huh...”
「どうしたん？　ここの暮らしに興味あるん？」=“What's up? You interested in life here?”
「こう自然が多いと、酸素が濃いって感じするよね」=“With this much nature, you can really feel how oxygen rich the air is, can't you?”
「あー確かになぁ、身体深くに染み込んでく感じあんねー」=“Ah, for sure~, it does feel like the air's seeping into all your cells, doesn't it~”
「やっぱ普段見たことない自然物が多いよね」=“There really are a whole lot of natural things here that you don't see in the city, huh?”
「うん、ＴＶとか本とかなら見たことあるけど、実際見るのは初めてなんが多いねぇ」=“Yeah, you see stuff like it in books or in TV sometimes but, it's the first time I've ever seen most of it~”
「この自然の中で生きていくって、改めてすごいと思うな」=“Coming here made me realize, living within nature like this really is something incredible.”
「でも、ここの島の人達はそれが当たり前なんよね」=“But, to the people here, it's just something they do everyday, isn't it?”
「この自然を全部堪能するとなるとどれだけかかるやら……」=“If you wanted to actually enjoy all that this island has to offer, just how much would you...”
「いろんなアクティビティ体験して、隅々まで見て回って……流石に大変やなぁ……」=“Doing all the activities they have here, and exploring every nook and cranny... does sound like a whole lot of effort, doesn't it~...”
「ここの島の生物は基本的に大人しいのかな？　これだけの自然の中で生きているのに」=“Even though there's so much nature around, are the island's creatures really this docile?”
「なんやろね？　人とうまく共存出来てるって事なんやない？」=“Who knows? Isn't it more that they just know how to co-exist with people?”
「これだけ綺麗な海を見ると、本当に同じ国なのか？　って思っちゃうよね」=“Looking at a sea this clean and pretty makes you question whether we're still in Japan, doesn't it?”
「ほんと、環境の差ってすごいと思うわぁ……」=“Seriously, it's amazing how much difference there is...”
「こういう綺麗な海の魚ってほんと特徴的だよね」=“The fish in beautiful seas like these tend to be really unique, don't they?”
「カラフルやし、見た目もめっちゃ特徴的やしなぁ」=“Yep, the fish here are so colorful, and they look very unique too.”
「この海は基本穏やかだし、波の音が心地いいよね」=“This island is just so relaxing in general, and the sound of the waves feel great too, don't they?”
「波の音ってヒーリング効果あるっていうけど、今ならめっちゃわかるわぁ……」=“You always hear how the sound of the waves have a healing effect but, I finally get it now...”
「海が綺麗過ぎると、泳ぎたい反面、本当にここで泳いでいいのか？　ってなったりしない？」=“When the sea's this pretty, it really makes you ask yourself if it's okay to swim in it, doesn't it?”
「あー、それはちょっとわかるかも……でも泳がないのはもったいなか……」=“Ah~, I feel like I get that... but it'd be a waste not to...”
「ここの海が綺麗なのはこの島の人達の努力でもあるよね」=“It's all thanks to the locals that the sea here is so pretty, isn't it?”
「そうやな、こげん綺麗な海を維持してくれた人々に感謝やね」=“Yeah, we gotta be grateful to them for preserving it like this.”
「綺麗な海に囲まれた島……それだけでも十分素敵な島だよね」=“Just the fact that it's surrounded by a sea like this... makes this place wonderful, doesn't it?”
「うん。しっかり、この海や風景を思い出に焼き付けていかんとね」=“Yep. We gotta make sure to burn this island and this scenery into our memories.”
「やっぱり、この島の物を使った名産品が多いみたいだね」=“Seems like there's a whole lot of local specialties that make use of local produce, huh?”
「そりゃぁ名産品やけん、島の物で作るのは当然やん？」=“Well yeah, they're local specialties, what else would they make 'em out of?”
「この島の地元料理も名産としてあったりするのかな？」=“I wonder if the local cuisine counts as a regional speciality too?”
「あー、確かあったと思うよ？　お店で見たかもしれん」=“Ah~, I'm pretty sure it does. I think I've seen them selling it like that in some shops.”
「名物と言ったら、やたら主張の強い食べ物や飲み物があるよね」=“Speaking of local specialties, there's a whole lot of very strong looking dishes or drinks, huh?”
「極端に甘かったり、辛かったり……心当たりあるわぁ……」=“Super sweet stuff, and super spicy stuff too... I've come across it too...”
「沢山名産品を買って、思い出として残していきたいなぁ」=“I wanna buy lots of local souvenirs here, as keepsakes.”
「でも買い過ぎは注意せんとよ？　土産物って結構お値段馬鹿にならんけん……」=“Be careful not to go overboard, okay? The tourist tax can really make the price add up...”
「名産と言えば、用途がよくわからないものとかよくあるよね」=“On the topic of local specialties, there's a whole lot of things you can't make heads or tails out of, aren't there? What they're used for and whatnot.”
「うん、たぶん置物なんやろうけど、本当にそれでええん？　ってのもあるよねぇ」=“Yep, they're probably just ornaments but, some of them really make you wonder if that's all there is to them, don't they?”
「こういうところの名産品って、やっぱり呪い的な効果があったりするのかな？」=“Say, the arts and crafts in places like these, do you think they can have some sort of cursed effects to them or whatever?”
「あるんやない？　というか見た目からして、みたいなのもあったりするし……」=“Probably, no? I mean, there's some that really do look like they do...”
「この島独特のエッチとかってあったりするのかな？」=“I wonder if there's any special kind of sex that you can only have here?”
「独特って、体位とか？　それとも道具とか……って変な事想像させんとぉ！」=“You mean like a specific position? Or a unique tool... wuh, don't make me imagine weird things!”
「こういう所って、絶対精力付きそうな食べ物や飲み物があるよね……」=“These sorts of places always have some sort of a local energy boosting food or drink, don't they...”
「……見つけても一人で食べちゃダメやけんね？　私も食べなきゃ、絶対持たんし……」=“...Even if you find something, you gotta share, okay? You can't have it all, I won't last in bed that way...”
「バカンス気分で、朝から晩まで一日中エッチな事とか……」=“You know, since this is basically a vacation, nothing stops us from shutting ourselves in and having sex from morning to night...”
「……ちょっと、いやめっちゃ興味あるけど、この島をもっと堪能せんとね……？」=“...That does sound a bit, no, it sounds very appealing but, we gotta savour this island too, you know...?”
「もぉ、そげん話せんとよぉ……っ」=“Jeez, no talking about that stuff...--”
「こらぁ、そげん恥ずかしい事言えんよぉ……っ」=“Hey~, don't say such embarrassing things...--”
