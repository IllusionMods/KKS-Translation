「気になるアクティビティとかってある？」=“Any activities you're interested in?”
「んー、どれもこれも、みーんな気になるけん」=“Nh- I'm interested in all of them.”
「やっぱこの島に来たからには全部のアクティビティ回りたいよね」=“After all, since we came to the island, we want to visit all the activities, don't we?”
「うん、全部やってたらめっちゃ体力付きそうやなぁ……」=“Yeah, but I'm sure you have to go all out to do them all.”
「ここのアクティビティって、ほんと自然をうまいこと使ってるよね」=“The activities here really make good use of nature, don't they?”
「まぁそれこそがアクティビティってことなんやない？」=“Well, isn't that what the activities are all about?”
「もし自分オリジナルのアクティビティを作るとしたらどんなのが浮かぶ？」=“If you were to create your own original activity, what comes to mind?”
「うーん、そう簡単には浮かばんねぇ、すでに色々あるけん……」=“Hmmm, there's a lot, so it's not easy for me to come up with just one...”
「アクティビティ、やっぱ見るのと実際にやるのじゃ全然感じ方が違うよね」=“The activities seem simple, but seeing them, and actually doing them, is completely different, isn't it?”
「流石に比べもんにならんね、まだやったことない人には是非ともやってほしかー」=“There's no comparison between the two. I highly recommend that you do them yourself-”
「この島の良さを知るためにも、いろんなアクティビティに挑戦しないとね」=“I gotta try all kinds of activities to get a good grip on what the island's all about, don't I?”
「そうやね、文字通り身をもって知ることが出来るけんね」=“That's right. You can literally learn for yourself.”
「自然の中での暮らし、かぁ……」=“So, living in nature, huh...”
「どうしたん？　ここの暮らしに興味あるん？」=“What's that? you interested in living here?”
「こう自然が多いと、酸素が濃いって感じするよね」=“When there's so much nature around, it seems like there's more oxygen, doesn't it?”
「あー確かになぁ、身体深くに染み込んでく感じあんねー」=“Ah- it's true. There's this feeling of it being absorbed deeply into your body-”
「やっぱ普段見たことない自然物が多いよね」=“There's so many natural things I've never seen before, you know?”
「うん、ＴＶとか本とかなら見たことあるけど、実際見るのは初めてなんが多いねぇ」=“Yeah, I've seen them in on TV and in books, but it's the first time I've seen so many with my own eyes.”
「この自然の中で生きていくって、改めてすごいと思うな」=“I think it'd be amazing to live in this natural environment.”
「でも、ここの島の人達はそれが当たり前なんよね」=“But it's just normal life for the island's people.”
「この自然を全部堪能するとなるとどれだけかかるやら……」=“I wonder how long it would take me to enjoy all this nature...”
「いろんなアクティビティ体験して、隅々まで見て回って……流石に大変やなぁ……」=“Experiencing all the activities, and checking out every nook and cranny... it's hard work...”
「ここの島の生物は基本的に大人しいのかな？　これだけの自然の中で生きているのに」=“The island wildlife is basically docile, isn't it? Even though they live in such a natural environment.”
「なんやろね？　人とうまく共存出来てるって事なんやない？」=“What's that, now? That means they can coexist well with people.”
「これだけ綺麗な海を見ると、本当に同じ国なのか？　って思っちゃうよね」=“When I see such a beautiful ocean, I wonder how we can be in the same country, you know? What do you think?”
「ほんと、環境の差ってすごいと思うわぁ……」=“I think the differences in the environments are amazing...”
「こういう綺麗な海の魚ってほんと特徴的だよね」=“These beautiful ocean fish are really distinctive.”
「カラフルやし、見た目もめっちゃ特徴的やしなぁ」=“They are quite colorful, and they have very distinctive appearances.”
「この海は基本穏やかだし、波の音が心地いいよね」=“When the ocean's so calm like this, the sound of the waves is really soothing.”
「波の音ってヒーリング効果あるっていうけど、今ならめっちゃわかるわぁ……」=“I've hear that the sound of waves has a healing effect, but now I totally get it...”
「海が綺麗過ぎると、泳ぎたい反面、本当にここで泳いでいいのか？　ってなったりしない？」=“When the ocean's so clear, I want to swim in it... but on the other hand, is it really okay to swim here? You feel that way?”
「あー、それはちょっとわかるかも……でも泳がないのはもったいなか……」=“Oh- that kinda makes sense... but it would be a shame not to swim...”
「ここの海が綺麗なのはこの島の人達の努力でもあるよね」=“Isn't the reason the ocean's so beautiful here is because of the islander's efforts?”
「そうやな、こげん綺麗な海を維持してくれた人々に感謝やね」=“That's true. We should appreciate the people who keep the ocean so clean.”
「綺麗な海に囲まれた島……それだけでも十分素敵な島だよね」=“The island, surrounded by such a beautiful sea... that alone is enough to make the island great.”
「うん。しっかり、この海や風景を思い出に焼き付けていかんとね」=“Yeah. I gotta make sure I burn the sea, and the scenery, into my memories.”
「やっぱり、この島の物を使った名産品が多いみたいだね」=“There seems to be a lot of specialty products made on the island, after all.”
「そりゃぁ名産品やけん、島の物で作るのは当然やん？」=“They're local specialties, so it's only natural make them from the island's products, isn't it?”
「この島の地元料理も名産としてあったりするのかな？」=“I wonder if the island's local cuisine is also considered a specialty?”
「あー、確かあったと思うよ？　お店で見たかもしれん」=“Oh- I'm pretty sure it is, you know? I might have seen some at the store.”
「名物と言ったら、やたら主張の強い食べ物や飲み物があるよね」=“Speaking of specialties, there's food and drink here that really stand out.”
「極端に甘かったり、辛かったり……心当たりあるわぁ……」=“They're extremely sweet or spicy... I know exactly what you mean...”
「沢山名産品を買って、思い出として残していきたいなぁ」=“I'd like to buy a lot of souvenirs, and keep them as mementos.”
「でも買い過ぎは注意せんとよ？　土産物って結構お値段馬鹿にならんけん……」=“Be careful not to overbuy, okay? Souvenirs can be quite pricey...”
「名産と言えば、用途がよくわからないものとかよくあるよね」=“Speaking of souvenirs, there's often stuff you have no idea what it's for.”
「うん、たぶん置物なんやろうけど、本当にそれでええん？　ってのもあるよねぇ」=“Yeah. maybe they're ornaments, but are you sure that's even what you want? There's that, too.”
「こういうところの名産品って、やっぱり呪い的な効果があったりするのかな？」=“I wonder if any of the island's specialty products have any kind of magical effect, after all?”
「あるんやない？　というか見た目からして、みたいなのもあったりするし……」=“Do they? I mean, sometimes it's like they do, from the looks of them...”
「この島独特のエッチとかってあったりするのかな？」=“Think there's any kind of sex that's unique to the island?”
「独特って、体位とか？　それとも道具とか……って変な事想像させんとぉ！」=“Unique, like in positions? Or toys, and stuff... don't make me imagine weird things!” 
「こういう所って、絶対精力付きそうな食べ物や飲み物があるよね……」=“In places like this, there's foods and drinks that definitely give you a lot of energy...”
「……見つけても一人で食べちゃダメやけんね？　私も食べなきゃ、絶対持たんし……」=“...even if you find some, don't eat them by yourself, okay? I have to eat them, too, or I'll never last...”
「バカンス気分で、朝から晩まで一日中エッチな事とか……」=“When I'm on vacation, I feel like having sex all day long, morning till night...”
「……ちょっと、いやめっちゃ興味あるけど、この島をもっと堪能せんとね……？」=“...I'm a little... no, I'm a lot interested... but is it okay if we enjoy the island some more...?”
「もぉ、そげん話せんとよぉ……っ」=“Geez, don't talk like that...!”
「こらぁ、そげん恥ずかしい事言えんよぉ……っ」=“Hey! Aren't you ashamed, talking like that...!”
