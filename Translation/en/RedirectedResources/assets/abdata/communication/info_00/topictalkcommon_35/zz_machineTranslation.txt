「うーん、そう簡単には浮かばんねぇ、すでに色々あるけん……」=“Well, it's not so easy to come up with something. There are already a lot of activities on .......”
「アクティビティ、やっぱ見るのと実際にやるのじゃ全然感じ方が違うよね」=“There's a big difference between seeing an activity and doing it, isn't there?”

「うん、たぶん置物なんやろうけど、本当にそれでええん？　ってのもあるよねぇ」=“Yeah, they're probably just ornaments, but are they really worth it?　Yeah, maybe it's an ornament, but is it really worth it?”
「こういうところの名産品って、やっぱり呪い的な効果があったりするのかな？」=“Do you think that the specialties of such places have a curse-like effect?”
