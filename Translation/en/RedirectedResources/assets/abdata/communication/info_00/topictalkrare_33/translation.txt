「[H名]さん、ホエールウォッチングって興味ある？」=“[H名]-san, are you interested in whale watching?”
「この島の名物だもの、もちろんあるわ」=“It's a famous attraction here, so of course.”
「運がよければ歌が聴けたり、ジャンプしている姿も見られるんだってね」=“If you're lucky, you can hear them sound out for you, and apparently they sometimes even jump.”
「あなた、自分の運に自信ある方？」=“Do you believe in your own luck?”
「え？　うーん……あるかも」=“Eh? Mmm... maybe.”
「あら、自分のことを運がいいなんて言う人、あなたが初めてよ。ふふふ」=“Oh my, this is the first time I've ever come across someone who doesn't think he's ridden with bad luck. Fufufuh~”
（[H名]さんと出会えた時点で運がいいに決まってるんだよなぁ……）=(I mean, once I met you, my luck was already decided, you know~...)
「ヤシガニのこと、どのくらい知ってる？」=“How much do you know about coconut crabs?”
「あんまり知らないけど、今頃がちょうど繁殖期だったんじゃなかったかしら」=“Not all that much but, isn't it just about breeding season for them?”
「まさかのそこ？」=“Seriously, that?”
「雑誌か何かで見たんだけど、この前岩場で致してるのを見て思い出したのよ」=“I think I read that in a magazine once, and it immediately came to mind when I came across a pair doing it near the beach.”
「おお、現場を……」=“Ooh, you saw them actually doing it...”
「ふふふ、情熱的で結構なことよね」=“Fufuh--, it's nice to be passionate, isn't it?”
「月桃って香水になってるらしいけど……この香りってもしかして？」=“I've heard they even make perfume out of shell gingers... are you using that, by any chance?”
「あら、気づいた？　今日は太ももの内側につけてるの」=“Oh my, you noticed? I used it between my thighs this morning.”
「太ももの、内側……」=“Between your, thighs...”
「あら、太ももの内側は体温が高いから、香りが立ちやすいのよ」=“Oh my, it's just that it gets really hot down there, so the scent really travels.”
「そ、そうなんだ」=“I-I see.”
「ほら、月桃の香りが好きならもっと近くで嗅いでみたら？　ふふふ」=“C'mon, if you like it, why don't you come closer and smell it? Fufufuh~”
「この島で人気の動物といえばヤマネコだよね」=“As far as popular animals here go, wildcats rank pretty high, don't they?”
「人気だけど、触れられないのが残念よね。ネコなら撫でたいもの」=“They do but, it's a shame that they won't let you touch them. I just can't help but want to stroke cats.”
「[H名]さん、ネコ好きなんだ」=“You like cats, huh?”
「なんとなくわかるでしょうけど、波長が合うのよね」=“I'm sure you can tell but, cats and me are pretty much on the same wavelength, you know?”
「わかる、ネコが寄ってきそうな雰囲気を纏ってるからねぇ」=“I get you, you've got that sort of aura that'd attract cats.”
「だから餌をカバンに入れてた時期もあるんだけど……」=“So there was a time when I used to always carry some food for them in my bag but...”
「ヤマネコには当然あげちゃだめでしょうね。はぁ、ネコが触りたくなっちゃった」=“We definitely can't go around feeding the wildcats here, can we? Haah, now I want to stroke a cat.”
「俺じゃだめ？」=“How about me? Or am I not good enough?”
「だーめ。ネコにあなたの代わりが務まらないようにね、ふふふ」=“Nope~. Try not to let a cat take your place, okay? Fufufuh~”
「流れ星見たら、願い事ってする？」=“Would you make a wish, if you saw a shooting star?”
「私はしないわね。信じてないというより、あって思った時には消えてるの」=“I wouldn't. Not to say I don't believe in them, but they're gone by the time you realize anyway.”
「あの一瞬で３回は無理だよね」=“Yeah, it'd be pretty hard to make a wish 3 times within that instant, wouldn't it?”
「するとしたら流星群のときを狙うしかないわね」=“No option but to hope and pray for a meteor shower, really.”
「ちなみに[H名]さんの願い事って？」=“Incidentally, what would you wish for, if you could?”
「内緒……って言いたいところだけどあなたにだけは教えてあげる」=“That's a secret... is what I'd like to say, but I'll let you in on it, because you're special.”
「この島で素敵な思い出ができますように、よ」=“I'd wish to be able to make wonderful memories on this island.”
「実はもうあなたのお陰で叶ってる夢だけど、できればもう少し……ね？　ふふふ」=“You've actually made that wish come true for me already but, you won't blame me for being greedy... right? Fufufuh~”
（おぉ……な、何か期待されてる気がする、頑張るぞ……）=(Oooh... I-I feel like she's expecting something special, I'll do my best...)
「サガリバナってロマンチックだと思うんだけど、[H名]さんは好き？」=“I think mango pines are really romantic but, do you like them, [H名]?”
「意外かもしれないけど好きよ。物語性のあるものが好きなの」=“It might be surprising, but I do. I love things with stories to them.”
「物語性？」=“Stories?”
「サガリバナは一夜しか咲かない花として、私も含めて皆を感動させるけど……」=“As flowers that only bloom for one night, they have the power to move everyone, including me, but...”
「その感動はきっと、私たちが心の中で物語を作っているからよね」=“I imagine that's only because we're creating stories around them in our hearts, no?”
「ああ、想像力をかきたてられる、みたいな」=“Aah, so you're saying that they're good at rousing your imagination, huh?”
「そう、そういうものが好きなの」=“Exactly, I love stuff like that.”
「なるほど。そういうものって、他にはどんなものがあるの？」=“I see. What sort of other things are like that, for you?”
「ものじゃなくて人だけど、あなたなんてそうね。想像力をかきたてられるわ」=“It's not a 'thing' but another good example is you. You always stir up my imagination.”
「ずっと見守ってた鳥の巣の卵が孵ったんだよ」=“This birds' nest that I've been watching over for the longest time finally had the egg in it hatch.”
「あら、素敵な話ね。刷り込みは大丈夫？　親鳥の前にあなたを見たら大変よ」=“Oh my, that's wonderful news. Did it imprint on its mommy fine? You really wouldn't want it imprinting on you, you know.”
「初めて見た誰かを親だと思っちゃうってやつだよね。大丈夫だよ」=“You're talking about how birds imprint on the first being they see, right? Don't worry, it imprinted fine.”
「どんなことでも初めてって大事だものね」=“The first time's always an important one, no matter what it is, afterall.”
（[H名]さんが言うと、ちょっぴりエッチに聞こえるよな……）=(Somehow that sounds a bit lewd...)
「ふふふ、目は口程に物を言うっていうから気を付けてね」=“Fufufuh, the eyes are windows to the soul, you know? Be careful.”
「えっ！？　あ、いやっ……」=“Eh--!? Ah, no--...”
「あなたならそういう目で見られても嫌じゃないから慌てなくていいのよ」=“I really don't mind being looked at that way by you so you don't need to panic.”
「ただ、こう見えて私って初めてだらけだから、色々と優しくしてね」=“But, and it might not seem that way but there's a lot of firsts I've not experienced, so be gentle with me, okay?”
「え？　ええ、あ、うん」=“Eh? Eeh, ah, sure.”
（とりあえず頷いてしまった……どうなっちゃうんだろう？）=(For now, I nodded... I wonder what's this gonna lead to?)
「民宿の庭にあった植木鉢に水をあげてたら、アサガオが咲いたんだよ」=“I started watering this plant pot at the lodge a while ago, and finally a morning glory bloomed.”
「あら、小粋な夏を満喫してるわね」=“Oh my, how chic, you really are enjoying summer, huh?”
「え、子供のイメージだったけど、小粋かな」=“Eh? I thought you'd say it's pretty childish, is it really chic?”
「この島の古い建物とアサガオって妙に合うと思ってね、情緒があって私は好きよ」=“The old buildings here and morning glories go together surprisingly well, I really like the mood it creates.”
「[H名]さんの琴線に触れられたなら、育てた甲斐があったな」=“Well that makes the effort I put into raising it worth it then.”
「ふふふっ、私のために育てたんじゃないでしょう？　でも嬉しいわ」=“Fufufuh--, you weren't doing it for my sake to begin with though, no? But I'm happy regardless.”
「こうやって話題になってるわけだから、[H名]さんのためってことにしよう」=“Well, we're talking about it like this so let's just say it was for your sake.”
「くすくすっ♪　なら絵日記と読書感想文も楽しみしてるわね」=“*Giggle*♪ Alright then, I'm looking forward to the picture diary and the book report too, okay?”
「やっぱり子供のイメージ！？」=“So you thought of it as childish afterall!?”
「なんだかノスタルジックな気持ちになっちゃって。二人でしましょ」=“It just started feeling a bit nostalgic, that's all. Let's do it together.”
（図らずして[H名]さんとの夏がもっと楽しみになってきたぞ）=(I didn't expect that that'd lead to this, now I'm looking forward to spending summer together even more.)
「マンタの顔、くせになるよね」=“Mantas have really addictive faces, don't they? You just can't look away.”
「これは褒め言葉に聞こえるかわからないけど、あなたの顔もくせになるわよ」=“I don't know whether you'll take it as a compliment or not but, your face is really addictive too.”
「[H名]さんに褒めてもらえるような顔面じゃないと思うけど、嬉しいよ」=“I don't think my face is good enough to receive a compliment from you but, I'll take it.”
「あら、くせになるっていうのは愛着が湧いているということでしょう？」=“Oh my, being addicted to something means you're fond of it, no?”
「顔の造形は関係ないの。男も女も、いかにお互いをくせにさせるかよね、ふふ」=“The shape of your face doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's about both the man and the woman making each other addicted to them, no? Fufuh~”
「いかにお互いをくせにするか、か……」=“Making each other addicted, huh...”
（そういう意味では俺、[H名]さんの顔にやみつきだな）=(In that sense, I'm head over heels for her face.)
「海ほたるってミジンコの仲間だって知ってた？」=“Did you know that sea fireflies are in the same family as water fleas?”
「ええ、調べたもの。ハムスターを横から見たような見た目よね」=“Yes, I looked into it, afterall. They kind of look like a hamster does from the side, don't they?”
「あ、[H名]さんってそういうの調べるタイプなんだね」=“Ah, you're the type to look that sort of stuff up, huh?”
「研修旅行といっても旅行は旅行よね。来る前はガイドブックばかり読んでいたわ」=“Even if they call it a study tour, it's still a trip at the end of the day. I read the guidebook cover to cover before we came here.”
「それなら海ほたるのスポットも載ってそうだもんね」=“If it had that then it probably also had the spot in which they commonly show up, right?”
「いいえ、海ほたるは図書館の図鑑で見て知ったのよ。可愛いわよね、ふふふ」=“Nope, I learned about sea fireflies from a field guide at the library. They're adorable, aren't they? Fufufuh~”
（図書館で図鑑を読みふける[H名]さんか……絵になるな）=([H名]-san in a library, absorbed in a field guide, huh... I'd have loved to see that.)
「ウミガメって可愛いよね」=“Sea turtles are very cute, aren't they?”
「……あなただから言うわね。実は私、小さい頃にウミガメを食べたことがあるの」=“...I'll tell you because it's you. I've actually eaten sea turtle meat as a kid.”
「えっ！　ウミガメって食べられるの！？」=“Eh--! You can eat them!?”
「お店の数は少ないけれど、この辺りの島でも食べられたはずよ」=“There aren't many shops that serve them but, I'm sure you could find one around these parts.”
「食感としては馬肉に似てるんだけど、それがおいしくて、今でも好物なの」=“Texture-wise it's kind of similar to horse meat but, that's what makes it so tasty, I can tell you I'd love it still.”
「それはすごい経験してるね……」=“You've really experienced it all, huh...”
「みんなには内緒ね。可愛いウミガメグッズを買ってる手前、言えなくて」=“Don't tell the others, okay? They know I've bought all those cute sea turtle toys and whatnot, so I just can't tell them.”
「わかった、この話は俺の胸のうちに秘めておくよ」=“Got it, I'll keep it sealed deep within my heart.”
「ええ、そう言ってくれると思って話したの。複雑な心境だわ……」=“Yes, I knew you'd say that, that's why I told you. Honestly, it's such a burden...”
（[H名]さんって経験豊富なイメージあるけど、こういうのもあるのか……）=(She always did seem like a worldly girl but, I didn't expect that...)
「星の砂、お土産で買った？」=“Did you buy any starsand yet, as a souvenir maybe?”
「ええ、親戚の女の子がほしいって言ってたから」=“Yes, a relative of mine told me she wanted some.”
「へえ、親戚の女の子が……」=“Hoh, a relative of yours, huh...”
（[H名]さんが親戚のお姉さんだったら、ドキドキしたかなぁ）=(I wonder if it'd feel more thrilling, if [H名]-san was an elder sister cousin of mine instead?)
「いとこ同士の結婚は基本OKだけど、家族会議待ったなしよ？」=“For what it's worth, marriage between cousins is fine but, we'd have to make our case to our families, you know?”
「そうだよね……って、心の中を……！？」=“Damn, you're right... wuh, how'd you...!?”
「あなたってこういうときだけわかりやすいのよね、手に取るようにわかるわ」=“You're really easy to see through at times like these, I don't even need to think too much.”
「ウムイの鐘を鳴らしたカップルには長続きしてほしいよね」=“You'd want couples that've rung the bell of Umuy to last a long time, wouldn't you?”
「長続きすることだけが幸せじゃないけれど、そうね、できれば続いてほしいわね」=“Just lasting a long time isn't happiness in itself but, yeah, if possible, I'd wish for that.”
「なんていうか、無理して二人でいてほしいわけじゃなくて……」=“How do I say this, I'm not saying that I'd want them to force themselves to stay together, but like...”
「二人の仲が大変なときこそウムイの鐘を鳴らした時のことを思い出したりさ」=“But if their relationship's going through a rocky period, maybe they could remember the bell and try to make things work, and all.”
「ふふ、あなたのいいところがよく出ている考え方ね。そういうところなのよね」=“Fufuh, the way you think about things like that is what's so good about you, you know? It really is.”
「鐘を鳴らしたことを思い出すより、あなたに相談した方がいいと思うわ」=“Rather than thinking back to the bell, I think it'd be better if they came to you for advice instead.”
「いやいや、俺に鐘ほどのご利益はないよ」=“No way, I'm nowhere near as powerful as that bell.”
「[H名]さんの胸って、俺の性癖にドストライクなんだよね」=“[H名]-san, your chest fits my tastes just perfectly, you know?”
「ふふふ、急に何？　嬉しいから別にいいけれど」=“Fufufuh, what is it now? Not that I mind, I love that.”
「色に形に……揉み心地も本当に凄くて……はぁ、最高だ……」=“The color, the shape... even just the sensation of rubbing them... haah, they're the best...”
「言っておくけどそのストライクゾーン、私の胸を中心にして小さくなっていくわよ」=“I'm just letting you know this, but that 'taste' of yours actually honed in around my breasts and not the other way around, you know?”
「え！？　そうなの！？」=“Eh!? Really?!”
「私の魅力的な身体の虜になったんでしょう？　あなたの性癖の基準になって当然じゃない」=“You've become addicted to my sexy body, no? So it's only natural for your tastes to center around it too.”
（[H名]さん色に染められた俺か……うーん、いいなぁ）=(I got dyed in her colors, huh... nnn, I kinda like that.)
「[H名]さんって、これっていうフェチある？」=“[H名]-san, is there a particular kink that you can say is your main kink?”
「そうね、等身大フェチかしら？」=“Let's see, a kink for true-to-lifeness?”
「と、等身大？」=“T-True-to-lifeness?”
「私ってよく外見だけで判断されるから、そういうのに左右されないと興奮するの」=“People judge me a lot based on what I look like, so it really arouses me when someone doesn't let that influence them.”
「俺はちゃんとできてるかな？」=“Am I doing a good job of that?”
「もちろん。だって私をそのフェチに目覚めさせてくれたのはあなただもの♪」=“Of course. You're the one who made me wake up to that kink, afterall♪”
「[H名]さんってどういうときに欲求不満になる？」=“What makes you feel sexually frustrated, [H名]-san?”
「そうね……あなたとエッチしてからはそういうことは無縁ね」=“Let's see... sexual frustration stopped being a part of my life, after we had sex for the first time.”
「え、逆に？　した後の方がなるのかと」=“Eh? That way? Not the other way around?”
「あなたとエッチする前まではすぐ欲求不満になって一人でいじったりしたわ」=“Before we had sex, I'd get sexually frustrated over the slightest things and immediately start playing with myself.”
「そういうことをしたい相手がいないことがストレスだったのね」=“I was just stressed that I had nobody in my life who'd do that sort of stuff to me, you know?”
（なるほど……これからもエッチをするときは満足させてあげたいな……）=(I see... I wanna keep satisfying her like that, if I can...)
「[H名]さんとの初エッチ、よかったなぁ。今でも鮮明に思い出せるよ」=“Man, the first time we had sex was so good, [H名]. Even now, I can remember it vividly.”
「なあに、どうしたの急に、ふふふ」=“What~, why're you bringing that up now? Fufufuh~”
「すごく気持ちよかったから伝えたくて」=“It felt amazing so I just wanted to tell you.”
「んもう、本当にエッチなんだから……でも嬉しい、もっと私の身体にハマってね」=“Jeez, you're seriously so lewd... but I'm glad, become even more addicted to my body, okay?”
「うん、ずぶずぶハマっちゃう」=“Yep, I'll make sure to get 'deeply' addicted.”
「ふふふ、エッチな言い方。私のエッチの相手はあなたしかいないんだからもっと盛って♡」=“Fufuh, so lewd. You're the only one who can fuck me so get even more fired up♡”
「もしかして、いま誘ったらエッチしてくれる？」=“Say, if I asked you for it now, will you say yes?”
「さあ、それはあなたと私のフィーリング次第。いいかなと思ったら受け入れちゃうけど」=“Who knows, that depends on the feeling between you and me. I might just say yes if I feel like it.”
「でも、満足させる自信はあるよ？」=“But, I could satisfy you thoroughly, you know?”
「あらあら、お猿さんになってるときのあなたって、本当に可愛いのよね、うふふ」=“Oh dearie me, you just get so adorable when you're a monkey in heat~, ufufuh.”
