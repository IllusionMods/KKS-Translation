「ホエールウォッチングってやってみたい？」=“Is whale watching something you wanna try out?”
「そりゃ、ちょっとはね。めっちゃ近くで見られるんでしょ？」=“Well of course, a lil' bit. You can get real up close to them, right?”
「あ、写真撮りたいな～。ＳＮＳとかにあげたらバズっちゃうかも」=“Ah, I wanna take a picture with one~. It might go viral if I post it on the internet too.”
「一緒に撮るのはさすがに無理なんじゃ……」=“I think wanting to take a picture with a whale really is asking a bit too...”
「お願いしたら、写真撮るまで止まっててくれるかも」=“They might stop the boat for long enough for me, if I ask them nicely.”
「夢のある話になってきた。確かに、クジラは優しそうだしね……」=“Well, it's good to have dreams, I guess. Whales do seem pretty docile...”
「この前、ヤシガニを見つけたよ」=“The other day, I saw a coconut crab.”
「ヤシガニ？　あれあんましだよね。可愛くないし、しょせんヤドカリだし」=“A coconut crab? Those are way too overhyped, aren't they? They aren't very cute, just oversized hermit crabs really.”
「……ばっさりだね」=“...How ruthless.”
「しかも、すごい挟むらしいじゃん？」=“Not to mention, apparently their grip strength is something else entirely?”
「ああ、そうみたいだね。あんまり会いたくはないよね」=“Aah, seems like it, yeah. Don't really wanna get face to face with one.”
「やめといた方がいいって。グサーッ、ギャーッ、だよ？　怖くない？」=“Yeah, you better not. *clish*, *clash*, you know? Doesn't that sound scary?”
「そんなだったらそりゃ怖いよ」=“I mean, of course.”
「月桃って知ってる？」=“You know shell gingers?”
「あー、なんかこの辺りではちやほやされてる花でしょ」=“Ah, you mean those flowers that everyone's way too into, right?”
「ちやほやというか、まあ、あってる……かな？」=“Way too into"? I mean, I guess...?”
「香りが強いかな。アロマやエステに使われてるんだって」=“I think their aroma's pretty strong? Apparently it's used in aroma oils and beauty products and whatnot.”
「俺よりずっと詳しかった」=“You know a whole lot more than me.”
「ま、ね。アタシそういうの得意分野だから」=“Well, yeah. This stuff's what I'm good at.”
（興味なさそうだったのに……）=(She seemed so uninterested at first too...)
「ヤマネコって個人で飼うの禁止なんだってね」=“Apparently, you're legally not allowed to keep a wildcat as a pet.”
「それはそうでしょ。あれ、猛獣なんじゃなかったっけ」=“I mean, of course. Weren't they like wild beasts?”
「猛獣なの？　まあ、あんまり懐きそうなイメージはないかも」=“Are they? Well, they don't have the most friendly image, for sure.”
「マタタビとかも通用しなさそう」=“I don't think any cat powder would work either.”
「それは……どうなんだろ？　試したことがある人っているのかな」=“I... wonder? You think anyone's tried before?”
「さすがにない気はするけど……やってみたさはあるかも」=“I really don't think so, but... now I kinda want to, actually.”
「流れ星に願い事すると叶うって、誰が言い出したんだろうね？」=“I wonder who said it first, that wishing upon a shooting star can make wishes come true?”
「どうだろ？　わかんない。国とかかな」=“Who knows? I sure don't. Maybe the government.”
「……国ではないと思うけど」=“...I really don't think so.”
「言われたらすごい気になってきちゃった。誰？　なんの目的でそんな……」=“Now that you say it, I'm super curious. Who did it? With what aim...”
「はっ！？　成功体験の口コミじゃないの。発祥はネットだわこれ」=“Hah--!? It's not someone's anecdote about it working either. Definitely gotta be a troll from the net.”
「その話が生まれたのは近代じゃなさそうな気もする」=“I really don't think that it's that modern a belief though.”
「まあ、起源がなんでも信じれば叶う……みたいなのはあるんじゃないの？」=“Well, who cares where it started, as long as you believe in it hard enough... isn't that good enough?”
「そう言われると、うん、そつちの方が夢があるね」=“When you put it like that, yeah, that does sound a whole lot less jaded for sure.”
「つまり、流れ星はサンタクロースってわけ」=“Basically, shooting stars are just Santa Claus.”
「それはどうだろう」=“I don't know about that one.”
「サガリバナの花言葉は『幸運が訪れる』なんだって」=“Apparently, in flower language, mango pines mean "Good luck will come your way".”
「なるほど、見たら幸せになれる！　みたいなことね」=“I see, so seeing one will make you happy, huh!”
「咲いてるところを見つけにくいから、見られただけでもラッキーってことかな」=“I guess it's talking about how since it's hard enough as it is to find one, just seeing one blooming makes you lucky, and all.”
「お♪　なんだか興味あり気な感じ？」=“Oh♪ Is that interest I hear?”
「そりゃ、幸運になれるならね」=“Well I mean, who doesn't want to be lucky?”
「幸運にはもうなってるじゃん♪　こうやってアタシと一緒にいるんだし」=“You're already plenty lucky, dummy♪ You get to spend time with me like this.”
「……なるほど」=“...Makes sense.”
「納得しないでくれる？　こっちが恥ずかしくなっちゃうから」=“Could you not agree with me? You're gonna end up making me blush.”
「最近、よく見に行ってた鳥の巣で雛が孵ってたよ」=“This bird's nest I've been recently checking up on finally had the egg in it hatch.”
「いつの間に飼育員デビューしてたの？」=“Since when did you become a zoo caretaker?”
「飼ってるわけではないから」=“It's not like I'm taking care of it or anything.”
「この辺って野鳥多いらしいしね。そういう出会いも、まあ、ある……のかな」=“This area does have a whole lot of wild birds. So seeing one's, well, not unusual... I guess?”
「ふわふわで綿みたいだよ」=“It looked super soft and fluffy, like a cotton boll.”
「親ばかみたいなこと言い出した」=“The doting father suddenly makes an appearance.”
「可愛いのはいいけど、ちゃんと責任持てるの？　相手は生き物なんだよ」=“It's good that it's cute and all but, can you really take responsibility? It's a living breathing creature, you know?”
「だから、飼ってないって。普通に親鳥いるよ」=“Like I said, I'm not taking care of it. It's got a mommy bird and everything.”
「庭で育ててたアサガオが、やっと花をつけたんだよ」=“This morning glory I've been growing at the yard, finally bloomed flowers.”
「おー、自由研究ー？　育てきったのすごいじゃん」=“Oh~, doing independent research~? I'm amazed you got it to bloom.”
「アサガオはどうしても育てるのに失敗しちゃう、苦い思い出があるかも……」=“I think I have some bitter memories, of trying to raise one myself long ago and failing every time...”
「ああ、たまに聞くね」=“Aah, yeah, that's not uncommon.”
「アタシって愛の女だから。水とかついやりすぎちゃって」=“I just love way too much, you know? I always end up overwatering flowers.”
「なんだろね？　与えるのが好きなのかな」=“I wonder why? Maybe I just like giving.”
「……これ、アサガオの話だよね？」=“...We're talking about flowers still, right?”
「もちろん。ふふ♪　他の意味に聞こえた？」=“Of course. Fufuh♪ Did you hear it as something else~?”
「マンタってけっこう見つけ辛いらしいね」=“Seems like it's pretty hard to come across mantas, huh?”
「ああ、あのでっかいエイ？　そっか、そんなに珍しいんだ」=“Aah, you mean those big rays? I see, so they're that rare, huh?”
「ダイビングとかでも人気らしいけど、タイミングが悪いと全然ダメなんだって」=“Apparently a whole lot of people go diving just to see one, but if your timing's wrong then you won't ever find one.”
「へー、ケチケチしてるねー」=“Heh, must be a pretty stingy fish~”
「マンタはあんまり人間の事情に興味ないかもね……」=“They might just not care about what we humans want...”
「アタシは別に会わなくていいかな。潜ったりしたら髪が濡れちゃうし」=“I think I'm good, personally. If one jumped out of water near me, my hair would get all messy anyway.”
「とか言ってる人の前にこそフラッと現れそう」=“I feel like it's exactly in front of people like you that they'd show up.”
「海ほたると山ほたるって、どう違うかわかる？」=“You know the difference between sea fireflies and regular fireflies?”
「……生息地？」=“...The region they inhabit?”
「そうだけど、そもそも山のは虫だし、海のは全然別の生き物らしいよ」=“I mean, yeah but, the regular ones are just bugs, while sea fireflies are apparently a whole different type of creature.”
「あー、きくらげとクラゲみたいな」=“Ah, like weeds and seaweed.”
「ばっちりなたとえな気がしてきた……」=“That's an almost bang on analogy...”
「先は山のほたるかな？　ほたる先輩？」=“Did regular fireflies come first? Are they the senpais?”
「かな？　両者が出会うことは永遠にないだろうけどね」=“I guess? I imagine the two species won't ever get to meet though.”
「ウミガメって、ちょっとのんごりしてるイメージあるよね」=“Sea turtles have this kinda meek image to them, don't they?”
「はいはい、浜辺で子供達にいじめられてるパターンね」=“Ah yeah, you mean that whole thing with kids bullying them on beaches and whatnot, right?”
「竜宮城？」=“Urashima Tarou from the Palace of the Dragon King?”
「いいよね、竜宮城～。飲めや歌えの大騒ぎ」=“Yeah. It's so nice, isn't it~? All you can drink, all you can sing, till you drop.”
「最後はおじいちゃんだよ」=“The story ends with him turning into a fossil, you know.”
「あは、アタシは竜宮城にいつまでも居座って帰らないし。一生遊んで暮らすの」=“Ahah, well I wouldn't leave the palace myself, I'd stay there all my life and have fun all day everyday.”
「なんて迷惑な……」=“You'd just be a bother...”
「星の砂って人気あるんだってね？」=“Apparently starsand's pretty popular, huh?”
「人気ねぇ。あれってちっちゃい微生物みたいなのじゃなかったっけ？」=“Popular, huh? Wasn't it all like tiny dead microbes or something?”
「それ言っちゃうとロマンのかけらもないね」=“You're really saying the quiet part out loud there.”
「まあ、冷めたこと言い出したらダイヤモンドだってただの石だし」=“Well, if you really start focusing on the details, even a diamond's just a rock at the end of the day.”
「大切なのは思い出の付加価値かな。誰かさんにプレゼントしてもらったり～」=“What's really important is the value that memories add to them. Like maybe if a certain someone gifts them to you~”
「ど、どこかで売ってるかな」=“I-I wonder if they sell any nearby.”
「ウムイの鐘って今まで何組くらいのカップルを見届けてきたんだろう」=“I wonder how many couples have went and gotten the blessings from the Bell of Umuy?”
「メルヘンな言い方するね。うーん、どうだろう……」=“Really talking like it's a fairy tale, aren't you? Nnn, I wonder...”
「別れたカップルはノーカン？」=“Are we counting couples that have broken up?”
「……やむを得ない事情があるケースもあるだろうし」=“...Well, I mean, there's always extraneous circumstances out of the people involved's control, too.”
「そうだけど。鐘はやっぱり残念がるんじゃない？　みんな幸せになって欲しいでしょ」=“Yeah but, wouldn't the bell feel really vexxed anyway? I mean, it wants everyone to be happy, no?”
（自分もそこそこメルヘンなこと言ってるような……）=(I'm not a judge but, I feel like she's talking like it's a fairy tale herself...)
「胸はミルクをあげるためのものなのに、不思議だ……」=“It's really weird, breasts are supposed to be for providing milk, and yet...”
「真面目な顔して変なこと言い出した」=“I'm surprised you can say something like that with such a straight face.”
「女の子はあれこれされると気持ちいいでしょ？　なんでだろうと思って」=“I mean, girls like it when guys touch them and fondle them there, no? So I was wondering about the why of it.”
「ばかかていうかそんなの……び、敏感だから結果そうなるってだけでしょ」=“Are you dumb or something... i-it's just that they're sensitive, no? That's the why.”
「ちなみに、おっぱい感じる方？」=“Incidentally, do you like it when I do it?”
「……変態」=“...Pervert.”
「女の子にもフェチってあったりするのかな？　ここに興奮するとか」=“Do girls have fetishes too? Like "this thing really arouses me", and all.”
「うーん、フェチかー」=“Nnn, fetishes, huh~?”
「やっば仕草？　車の運転する手付きがエロいって聞いたことあるけど」=“I guess a guy's quirks and whatnot? I've heard how some girls find the sight of their boyfriends driving really erotic before.”
「大人なこと言い出したね……」=“You're sounding actually mature there...”
「日常の中に潜むエロスにぐっとくるのよ、女は」=“The eros lurking within regular everyday life is what really hits women, you know.”
「車の運転はエロスなんだ。な、なかなか深いね……」=“A man driving is eros, huh? H-How profound...”
「欲求不満な時って辛いよね」=“Sexual frustration is really hard to deal with, isn't it?”
「それ誘ってんの？」=“Are you asking me for it?”
「いやいや、ただの世間話だから」=“No no, just some small talk.”
「……世間話の範囲広くない？　まあ、それは……女だってムラムラする時くらいあるけど」=“...Isn't your scope of small talk kinda wide? Well, still... girls get horny too, you know.”
「……こほんっ」=“...*cough*--”
「自分で言っといて照れないでくれる？　誘ってないから」=“Could you not blush after saying that yourself? I really am not asking for it.”
「あのさ、この前のことなんだけど。あの後……」=“Listen, the other day, when we did it. After that, were you...”
「あ、あんまし改まらないでくれる？　身体とかは別に普通だから」=“C-Could you not ask about awkward stuff like that? My body feels more or less fine.”
「そりゃ、した後はアソコに違和感あったけど。嬉しい方が大きかったし」=“I mean, of course, I felt very sensitive down there for a bit after we did it but, the happiness outweighed it by a ton.”
「触られるのとか、うん、新鮮な……って、言わせないでよ」=“Being touched and stuff is, yeah, a really new sensation for... wuh, don't make me say it.”
「ごめん！　でも、嫌な思い出になってないならよかった。不安だったから」=“Sorry! But, it's all good then, as long as it's not a bitter memory or anything. I was worried, you know.”
「心配しすぎ。女はちょっとの痛みくらい乗り越えられるようになってるの」=“You worry too much. Women are built to withstand a bit of pain here and there.”
「女の子は強いんだね」=“Girls really are strong, huh?”
「強かったり弱かったりすんの。色々サイン出していくから、ちゃんと読み取ってね」=“Both strong and weak, we flip flap. I'll make sure to give you enough signals, so make sure to pamper me at those times, okay?”
「頑張ってみます」=“I will endeavour to do my best.”
