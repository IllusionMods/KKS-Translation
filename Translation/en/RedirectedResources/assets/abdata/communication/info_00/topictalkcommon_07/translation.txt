「もしかして、全部のレジャーを制覇するつもりでいる？」=“Wait, are you planning on conquering every single activity this island has to offer?”
「当たり前だろ？　遊びつくさなきゃ損だぜ！」=“Of course? An island like this, you lose if ya don't enjoy it fully!”
「あったかいから、歩いてるだけで汗をかいちゃうよね」=“It's real hot so, just walking around makes you all sweaty, doesn't it?”
「汗だくになるから、タオルがかかせないよな」=“Yeah, and with how sweaty you get, you almost gotta walk around with a towel in hand, don'tcha?”
「いつから運動は得意だった？」=“Since when have you been this good at sports?”
「ん～……得意だったかは覚えてないけど、昔から身体を動かすことは好きだったぜ」=“Nn~... I don't really remember when I started getting into sports specifically but, I've always loved moving my body.”
「男はやっぱり筋肉質な方がいいかな？」=“I guess men are better if they're muscular?”
「まぁ、そうじゃないか？　筋肉は色んなことを解決してくれるしな」=“I mean, I'd guess so? You can do a whole lotta things with some decent arms and legs.”
「もっと体力をつけた方がいいのかな？」=“Should I train my stamina some more?”
「だな。体力があって損はしないぞ。いっぱい遊べるし良いこと尽くめだ」=“Yep. Having more is never gonna not help. And you can run around a whole lot too, there's only pros, really.”
「新しいレジャーを考えてみてって言われたら、どんなのを提案する？」=“If I told you to come up with a novel activity we haven't done, what would you suggest?”
「なんだろうな～……バンジージャンプとか？　って、ここでやるのは難しいか。ははは」=“I wonder~... bungee jumping, I guess? Then again, guess we can't really do it here. Hahahah.”
「この島って、変わった虫もたくさんいそうだよね」=“Bet this island has a whole lot of weird insects too.”
「そ、そんな恐ろしいことを言うな……外を出歩けなくなるだろ……」=“D-Don't bring up such terrifying things... I'm gonna become a shutin at this rate...”
「南国特有の動物や植物がいっぱいいるみたいだね」=“Seems like they've got a whole lot of flora and fauna local to only this part of the country, huh?”
「それってどんな感じなんだ？　私の想像では陽気な見た目をしてるんだけど……当たってるか？」=“What sort of flora and fauna would that be? I mean, in my head it all looks really cheerful and energetic but... is that right?”
「自然豊かだし、自給自足の生活が出来そうだよね」=“With this much nature surrounding this place, you could live pretty self sufficiently here, couldn't you?”
「素人考えで甘く見るのはよくないぞ。私が言うんだから間違いない」=“Don't take it so lightly with your amateur eyes. And I'm the one saying that, so you know it's good advice.”
「この島に秘境スポットってあるかな？」=“You think there's still any unexplored parts on this island?”
「根気よく探せば見つかるんじゃないか？　調べるなら私も付き合うぜ」=“We'd probably find something new if we really took our time and looked for it, no? If you're gonna do that, I'll tag along too.”
「違う季節に来たら、また違った自然の一面を見ることが出来そうだよね」=“If we stay long enough for another season, bet we'd get to see a whole new side to the nature on this island.”
「雪が積もったら楽しそうだよな～。え、雪は降らない？　じょ、冗談を言ったに決まってるだろ、はは……」=“It'd be real fun to play around in the snow, wouldn't it~? Eh? It doesn't snow? O-Of course, I was just joking, hahah...”
「今日も空が澄んでて、気持ちがいいね」=“The sky's real clear and nice today too, isn't it?”
「ホントにな！　いや～、天気が良くて助かるぜ。雨が降ったら外で遊べないからな」=“Seriously! Man~, weather like this is a lifesaver. Can't exactly run around outside in the rain.”
「深海魚って、けっこう愛嬌があると思わない？」=“Don't you think deep sea fishes are pretty charming?”
「そうかぁ？　不気味で、美味しくなさそうな見た目をしてるやつばっかりだと思うけどな」=“You think~? To me they all just look kinda weird and untasty though.”
「この島って、大体どこからでも波の音が聞こえてくるよね」=“No matter where you go on this island, you can hear the waves from just about any spot, can't you?”
「そうなのか？　あんまり気にしたことなかったな」=“Really? I've never really paid that much attention to it.”
「魚を飼ったことってある？」=“Have you ever kept a fish as a pet?”
「ないなぁ。もし飼うとしても観賞用じゃなくて、食用になりそうだ」=“Nope~. And if I did, I feel like it'd end up more as food than a thing to look at, eventually.”
「海の生き物になれるとしたら、何になりたい？」=“If you could become something within the sea, what would you want to be?”
「マグロだな！　めちゃくちゃ早く泳げるらしいから、どんなもんか体感してみたいぜ」=“Gotta be tuna! Seems like it's a real speedy one so, I wanna see for myself just how fast it is.”
「水族館の魚を見て、美味しそうって思ったことある？」=“Have you ever looked at the fishes in the aquarium and thought to yourself "Man, they sure look tasty"?”
「むしろない奴がいるのか？　刺身にするか、それとも煮るか焼くか……私はいつも想像するぞ」=“Is there anyone who hasn't? To make sashimi, or to boil or grill them... I can never escape those thoughts.”
「綺麗な海を見ると、泳ぎたくなるよね」=“With such a pretty sea in front of us, it just makes you wanna go for a swim, doesn't it?”
「なぁ！　ほんと、なんで人間は海の中で呼吸できないんだろうな～。出来るならずっと泳いでたいぜ」=“You know it! Seriously, just why can't we breath underwater~? I wanna swim all day if I can.”
「メニュー表を見ると、普段見かけない料理や飲み物の名前がいっぱいあるよね」=“The menus here usually have food and drinks the kinds of which we'd never see back home, don't they?”
「何が出てくるか、さっぱり分からねぇよな～」=“It's hard to know exactly what's even gonna come out, isn't it~”
「ここのお菓子を買ってみたんだけど、食べてみる？」=“I bought some local sweets, wanna try eating them together?”
「おお、くれるなら貰うぜ……って、真っ黒だな。これ、ほんとに食べれるのか？」=“Ooh, if you're handing them out then I'll try some... wuh, it's pitch black. Is this thing edible, even?”
「どこのお店でも、あの唐辛子の調味料は置いてるよね」=“Just about every place here uses that capsicum spice, doesn't it?”
「あれな～……どんなもんかと大量に振りかけたら、めちゃくちゃ辛くてさ……お前も気をつけた方がいいぞ」=“That, yeah~... I thought to see for myself just what it was all about and sprinkled a whole bunch onto my food, it was hellish... you be careful too.”
「何か気になる名物はあった？」=“Anything caught your eye here?”
「……赤い人型のストラップを見たことあるか？　よく売られてるんだけど、何がモチーフなのか全然分かんなくて気になってるんだよな～」=“...Have you seen that red, humanoid phone strap? You see it in almost every shop, but I don't get the motif at all, it's killing me~”
「買い物は、もう済ませた？」=“So, done your shopping yet?”
「目星はつけたが、まだ買ってないな。他に欲しいものが見つかるかもしれないから、最後に買うよ」=“I've got a general idea of what I wanna go for, but I still haven't actually done it. And who knows, maybe I'll want something more later so, I'll do it all at the end.”
「人への贈り物を選ぶのって難しいよね」=“It's really hard to pick out gifts for people, isn't it?”
「そうか？　自分が貰って嬉しいものなら、相手もだいたい喜んでくれると思うけどな」=“You think? I mean, as long as you buy something that you really like, the person you give it to would probably like it too, I think.”
「オナニー用のおもちゃを買ったことある？」=“Have you ever bought adult toys, for masturbation use?”
「んなっ！？　そ、そんなものを買ったことなんてないぞ！」=“Wwha--!? N-No way in hell I'd ever buy one of those!”
「チンコの話なんだけど、太いのと硬いのはどっちが好き？」=“Talking about dicks for a sec, which kind do you like more? A fat one or a rock hard one?”
「く、比べられるほど私に経験がないこと、知ってるだろ！？　そんなことを聞くな！」=“Y-You know that I'm not experienced enough with that shit to have an opinion, right!? So why're you asking!?”
「チンコを鍛える為に、俺も筋トレを頑張ろうかな」=“Maybe I'll start working out too, if only to make my cock even more tough.”
「いちいち私に言うなよ！　お前に筋肉がついた時に意識しちゃうだろ！？」=“Don't tell me all these things everytime! I'd notice once you get some muscle mass on you anyway, no!?”
「うぅ～、卑猥な話を私に振るな！」=“Uuu~, keep those indecent things to yourself!”
「女に振る話じゃないぞ！　もっと違う話をしてくれ」=“That's not something you talk about with a girl! Pick something different.”
