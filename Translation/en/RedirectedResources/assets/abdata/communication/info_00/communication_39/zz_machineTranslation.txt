「んぅ？　もうついたのー？」=“Hmm?　Are you there yet?”
「だめー、そんなとこ入ったら怒られるよー？」=“No, you can't go in there. You'll get in trouble.”
「なんか、ドキドキするさー……なんでかねー」=“I'm so nervous. ...... I don't know why.”
「その、島はあったかいから……ちょっと解放的な気分に、なったりしないねー？」=“Well, it's warm on the island, so it's a little ...... liberating, don't you think?”
「ひゃわっ！　うぅ、やられたさー。全然気づかなかったよー」=“Oh my God!　Ugh, I'm beat. I didn't even notice.”
「お話、いっぱいしたいさー」=“I have so much to tell you.”
「なんでも遠慮なく聞いてー、その方が嬉しいさー」=“Feel free to ask me anything. I'd love to hear it.”

「どっちも楽しいよー。でも男の子と二人きりだと、ちょっとドキドキするねー」=“Both are fun. I enjoy both, but I get a little nervous when I'm alone with a boy.”
「男子に聞いてみたい事とかある？」=“Do you have any questions you'd like to ask boys?”
「パッとは出てこないねー。何か思いついたら、また今度聞かせて欲しいさー」=“I can't think of anything off the top of my head. If you think of something, let me know.”

「優しい男子は好き？」=“Do you like gentle men?”
「えへ、もちろん。優しくされて嫌がる女子はいないよー」=“Yes, of course. I don't know any girl who doesn't like to be treated nicely.”
「適度ならいいけど、なよなよした人はお断りよー」=“I don't mind guys in moderation, but I don't like guys who are too pushy.”
「クール系な男子って、好きだったりする？」=“Do you like cool guys?”

「い、いきなり何を聞くねー。もう……特に変わった言い方なんてないよー」=“What are you asking me all of a sudden? I don't have any unusual way to say ...... anymore.”
「えぇっ、恋人はウムヤーとか言ったりするけど……え、エッチは変わらんよー」=“What? Lovers say "um-ya", but ...... sex is the same.”
「男女の仲って、エッチ抜きに成立すると思う？」=“Do you think a man and a woman can be together without sex?”
「わ、分からんさー。人によりけりだと思うよー」=“I don't know. I don't know. I think it depends on the person.”

「そ、そんなの教えんよー。そもそも、したくなる前提で話を進めないで欲しいさー」=“I'm not going to tell you. I'm not going to tell you. I don't want you to start assuming that I want to have sex with you.”
「それは……一人で、したりとか……うぅ、言わせんでよぉ」=“I don't want you to talk about it on the assumption that you're going to want to ...... have sex alone.”
「そういう話ばっかりしてると、女の子に気持ち悪がられるよー」=“If you keep talking about it like that, girls will think you're weird.”
「エッチな本とか読んだことある？」=“Have you read any porn magazines or the like?”
「まぁ、ちょっとくらいはあるさー。全然見たことがない方がおかしいはずよー」=“Well, there is a little bit of that. It's funny that you've never seen anything like it.”
「男子の身体に興味ある？」=“Are you interested in boys' bodies?”

「ふわぁ、ちょっと眠くなってきたさぁ……」=“Wow, I'm getting a little sleepy. ......”
「うーん、もう少しお話したかったけど、そろそろ時間がー」=“Well, I'd love to talk more, but I'm running out of time.”
「次はお話だけじゃなくて、スキンシップもしてみたいさー」=“Next time, I'd like to do more than just talk. I'd like to do some skin-to-skin.”
「それじゃ。またよろしく頼むさー」=“Well then. I'll see you soon.”
「おっと、もうこんな時間。それじゃあ、もう行こうねー」=“Oops, it's almost time. Let's get out of here.”
「さてー、こんな所かねー。楽しかったよー」=“Well, I guess that's it. That was fun.”

「ごめんねー。自分ちょっと、今は観光って気分じゃないばーよー」=“I'm sorry. I'm not really in the mood for sightseeing right now.”
「これから一緒に遊ばない？」=“Do you want to hang out with me?”
「そういうお誘いは大歓迎さー。なにして遊ぶー？」=“I welcome such an invitation. What are you going to do?”
「うーん、残念だけど……遊んでばっかりもいられないさー」=“Well, I'm sorry, but I can't keep playing at ...... all the time.”
「何かこの島独自の体験とか、一緒にしてみたくない？」=“Would you like to do something unique on this island with me?”
「それ、でーじ良いアイディアさー」=“That's a great idea.”

「今は何か食べたい気分じゃないさー。また今度ねー」=“I'm not in the mood for anything right now. See you next time.”
「ちょっと付いてきてくれない？」=“Would you like to follow me?”
「いいけど、変な所には行かないでよー？」=“Okay, but don't go to any weird places.”
「なんか怪しいさー。自分は行かんよー」=“It looks suspicious. I'm not going there.”
「もう、なんでかねー。自分じゃなかったら、通報されてるよー？」=“I don't know what's wrong with me. If it wasn't me, I'd be reported.”
「むぅ、怒らないであげるから、早く出ていくさー」=“Mmm, don't be mad at me. I'll get out of here.”
「じ、自分を覗きにきたの？　複雑な気分さぁ……」=“Oh, so you're here to spy on yourself?　It's complicated. ......”
「あー、変態を発見したさー！　覚悟はできてるー？」=“Oh, I've found a pervert!　Are you ready for this?”

「こらー、変なとこ見ないー。大声だすよー？」=“Don't look at me like that. I'm going to scream.”
「もう、目がでーじいやらしくなってるよー？」=“Your eyes are getting really hot.”
「うぅ、水着の上からでも、男子の視線は見るとこ同じねー」=“Ugh, even with the bathing suit on, the boys are looking at you the same way.”
「動くか喋るか、どっちかにしないと舌噛むよー」=“Either you move or you talk, or I'll bite my tongue.”
「こら待って。自分が止めなかったら、大変なことになってたよー」=“Wait a minute. If I hadn't stopped myself, I would have been in big trouble.”
「いっぱいお話したいねー。って、思ってるのは……自分だけかなー？」=“I want to talk to you. I'd love to talk to you. I wonder if I'm the only one who wants to talk to .......”
「お話以外のことも大歓迎よー。例えばー触りっことかー、えへへ……」=“You're welcome to do more than talk. I'd love to talk about something other than stories, like touching. ......”
「あいっ！？　まったく、キミは悪戯っ子で困るさー」=“What?　You're such a naughty boy.”
「ハイタイ！　今日もこの島はあったかくて、気分がいいさー」=“Hightail!　It's nice and warm on this island today.”
「キミは良く話しかけてくれるねー。なんか嬉しいさー」=“You talk to me a lot. It's nice to see you.”
「どしたのー？　自分に用事ー？」=“What's up?　You want to talk to me?”
「方言を直したいとかって思う？」=“Do you want to fix your dialect?”
「だからよー、直したいさーって、これも方言だねー。そうだねーって意味ー」=“So, I want to fix it." That's another dialect word. It means, "Yes, I do.”
「思わないねー。訛りも含めて自分さー」=“I don't think so. I don't think so. It's me, including my accent.”
「寒い所って、やっぱり嫌い？」=“Do you hate the cold?”
「うん、苦手ー。ちょっと動くのも嫌になるよー」=“No, I don't like it. I don't even like to move a little.”
「そうでもないよー。厚着すればいいしねー」=“Not really. I'll just wear heavy clothes.”
「[H名]はノリがいいから、話してて楽しいよ」=“You're fun to talk to because you're so friendly.”
「えへ、ありがとー。でーじ嬉しいさー」=“Thank you. I'm really happy.”
「そう？　ほんとはうるさいって思ってないー？」=“Really?　You don't think I'm annoying?”
「[H名]って人懐っこいって言われない？」=“Do people say you're friendly?”
「えへ、よく言われるねー。自分でもそうだと思ってるさー」=“Yeah, I get that a lot. I think I am.”
「うーん、実は誰にでもってわけじゃないよー。自分も人見知りするさー」=“Hmmm, not everyone is friendly, actually. I'm shy too.”
「んぅ？　よく聞こえなかったさー。他の話しよー」=“Hmm?　I didn't hear you well. Let's talk about something else.”
「会話に詰まった時ってどうしてる？」=“What do you do when you're stuck in a conversation?”
「ゆっくり考えればいいよー。自分は待っててあげるからー」=“Just take your time. I'll wait for you.”

「うーん。まだ自分にはそういうの早い気がして、考えられないねー」=“Hmmm. I don't think I'm ready for that kind of thing yet, so I can't think about it.”
「恋人にするなら、方言に理解ある人の方がいい？」=“If you're going to have a girlfriend, do you prefer someone who understands dialect?”
「もちろんさー。じゃないと文字通り、お話にならんよー」=“Of course. Otherwise, it's literally impossible to talk to you.”
「付き合った人の言葉に合わせるさー。意外と尽くすタイプだからねー」=“I'll adapt to the language of the person I go out with. I'm more of a servant type.”
「方言で大好きって言ってみて」=“Try saying "I love you" in dialect.”
「でーじ好き。かねー？　愛してるは……また違った言い方があるけどー」="I love you in dialect. Maybe?　There's a different way to say "I love you" at .......
「い、言わんよー。変な勘違いされたら、困るからねー」=“No, I won't say it. I'm not going to say it. I don't want people to think I'm crazy.”
「男子でコイバナ好きって珍しいねー。他の女の子となら話が合うかもしれんよー」=“It's rare to find a boy who likes to talk. You might be able to talk to other girls.”
「恋は盲目って言うけどさ、あれ本当かな？」=“They say love is blind. I wonder if that's true.”
「本当だはず。好きになったら仕方ないさー」=“It's true. You can't help it if you like someone.”
「一人エッチには時間かけるタイプ？」=“Are you the kind of guy who spends a lot of time having sex alone?”
「ま、まぁ……自分は何事も、ゆっくりするのが好きさー」=“Yeah, well, ...... I like to take my time with everything.”
「そ、そんなのパっと済ませるさー。もう、何言わせるのー」=“I like to take my time with everything. What do you want me to say?”
「なんか、いきなりエッチな気分になる時ってない？」=“Do you ever feel like you're about to get laid?”
「う、うん……その辺りは、男女関係なくあると思うさー」=“Yeah. ...... I think that happens to all men and women.”

「よ、よく分からないけど……あんまり急かされるのは嫌かもしれないさー」=“I'm not sure, but I don't like to be rushed into sex.”
「男の子はすぐしたいんだよね？　だったら、それに合わせるさー」=“I don't know.　Then I'll go along with it.”
「ポリネシアンセックスって知ってる？　５日間もかけてするらしいよ」=“Have you ever heard of Polynesian sex?　It's supposed to take five days.”
「うん、ちょっと憧れるねー。大好きな人とそんなにずっとしたら、絶対幸せさー」=“Yeah, it's kind of cool. Yeah, I'm kind of attracted to it. I'm sure I'd be happy doing it with someone I love for that long.”
「あいっ！　知らなかったよー。そんなにしてたら、溶けてしまいそうさー」=“Oh!　I didn't know that. I'd melt if I had to do it that long.”
「むー、欲求不満なら、一人で解消してきて欲しいさー」=“Mmm, if you're frustrated, go relieve yourself.”
「気温があったかいとエッチしたくなるのってなんでだろうね？」=“Why is it that when the temperature is warm, I want to have sex?”
「それは……脱いだりするものなんだし、寒いよりは温かい方がいいさー」=“It's ...... something to take off, and I'd rather be warm than cold.”
「はいはい、好きなだけ見ればいいさー。減るもんでもないしねー」=“Yes, yes, you can watch as much as you like. You can look at it as much as you want, it's not going to get any worse.”
「むー、自分の顔だけ見に来たのー？　ただ見られてるだけは飽きてきたよー」=“Mmm, did you come here just to see your own face?　I'm getting tired of just being watched.”
「好きなだけ見てればいいーって言ったけど、流石に見過ぎで呆れるさー」=“I told you to stare at me all you want, but you're staring at me too much.”
「ほんと、胸が好きだねー。男子って皆そうなのー？」=“You really like breasts, don't you? Are all boys like that?”
「怒られる前にやめるのが、お利口さんよー」=“You're a smart girl to stop before you get angry.”
「いい加減にしないとー、キミに胸を見られたーって、皆に言って回るよー？」=“If you don't stop, I'm going to go around telling everyone you've been looking at my breasts.”
「手を握るなんてダメだよー。ドキドキしてー、変な気分になるからー」=“Don't hold my hand. It'll make you nervous. It'll make you feel weird.”
「やめっ、手だって一応女の子の一部だからねー。勝手に触っちゃダメさー」=“Stop it. Hands are part of being a girl, you know. You can't just touch them.”
「もー、でーじ困った人さー。ほんとに怒られるからねー？」=“You're a real pain in the ass. I'll get really angry.”
「ふゃっ、待って……今、胸触って……うぅ、いくらなんでも怒るよー？」=“Wait, wait, ...... touch my breasts now, ...... I'm going to get angry, no matter what.”
「うっ、何度も触って……もう言い訳は聞かんからねー」=“Ugh, touch me again and again. ...... I won't hear any more excuses.”
「ひゃっ、女の子の胸はそんな簡単に触っていいものじゃないさー！　次は叩かれるよー？」=“No, you can't touch a girl's breasts that easily!　You'll get slapped next time.”
「えへ、くすぐったいさー。でも自分、何も褒められるようなことしてないよー？」=“Next time they'll hit you. - Yeah, that tickles. I'm ticklish, but I haven't done anything to deserve it.”
「撫で過ぎは逆効果さー。こういうのは、たまにするからいいのよー」=“Too much petting has the opposite effect. It's good to do this once in a while.”
「うー、そんなに撫でられても嬉しくないさー。しつこいと嫌われるよー？」=“I don't like to be petted that much. They don't like it when you pet them too much.”
「えへ、自分のほっぺ柔らかいでしょー。ちょっとくらいなら触ってもいーよー」=“It's okay to touch your cheeks a little. You can touch them a little bit.”
「ちょっとって言ったのに……キミはしつこいさー」=“I said just a little. ...... You're so persistent.”
「どれだけほっぺが好きなのー？　キミは変な人だねー」=“How much do you like my cheeks?　You're a weird one.”
「お話、もっといっぱいしたいねー？　そう思ってるのは自分だけー？」=“I want to talk to you more, don't I?　Am I the only one who thinks so?”
「なんか、キミと一緒にいると身体が火照ってくるさー。なんでだろねー？」=“I feel like my body is on fire when I'm with you. Why is that?”
「さーて、何しようかねー？」=“So, what do we do now?”
「どしたのー？　一人でなんか難しい顔してて、面白いさー」=“What's wrong?　What's the matter? You look like you're in trouble. It's funny.”
「キミといると、なんか時間があっという間だねー。えへへ～」=“Time flies when I'm with you, doesn't it? Hehehe.”
「なんか今日、熱くない？　自分の気のせいかねー？」=“Are you feeling hot today?　Is it my imagination?”
「それじゃ、また今度ねー。お話楽しかったさー」=“I'll see you later. It was fun talking to you.”
「あいっ、でーじ時間経ってたねぇ……えへ、びっくりさー」=“Hey, it's been ages. ...... I'm surprised.”
「あんまりキミを独り占めしちゃいけないし、このへんでお別れが丁度いいかねー」=“I don't want to keep you all to myself, so I think it's best if we say goodbye.”
「了解さー。ちょっぴり残念だけど、バイバイねー」=“Okay. I'm a little disappointed, but I'll say goodbye.”
「え？　なんだったのー？　からかうのは良くないよー」=“What?　What was that?　You shouldn't make fun of me.”
「俺さ……[H名]のことが好きなんだ。付き合って欲しい！」=“I like ......[H名]. I want you to go out with me!”
「ごめんねぇ……今はあんまり、キミとそういう関係になるのは考えられないかも……」=“I'm sorry, ......, but I don't think I'm ready for that kind of relationship with you right now. ......”
「自分ね……キミのことが好きになってしまったみたい。恋人に、なってくれない？」=“I think I've fallen in love with ...... you. Will you be my girlfriend?”
「そっかぁ……ちょっといきなり過ぎたよねー？　あは……今のは忘れてー」=“I see. ...... That was a bit abrupt, wasn't it?　Haha. ...... Forget about that.”
「あのさ、[H名]とエッチしたいって言ったら……どうする？」=“What would you do if I said I wanted to have sex with [H名]?”
「えぇ、いきなりすぎるさー。いくら自分でも、そんな簡単にいいとは言えんよー」=“Yeah, it's too sudden. I don't know if I'd be able to say yes so easily.”
「あのさ、また[H名]とエッチしたいな……」=“You know, I'd like to have sex with [H名] again. ......”
「はいはい、やっぱりねー。なんだかいやらしい目になってると思ってたよー」=“Yes, yes, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.”
「無理無理、なんで自分がキミの欲求解消に付き合わなきゃいけないのー？」=“No, no, no, no. Why should I be the one who has to deal with your needs?”
「ねぇ、ここでエッチしちゃわない？」=“Hey, do you want to have sex here?”
「え、だって……人いるよー？　うぅ、なるべく早く終わらせてねー？」=“Yeah, because there's ...... people here.　Ugh, let's get this over with as soon as possible, okay?”
「ちょっと待ってー。人がいる前でなんて、できるわけないばーよー」=“Wait a minute. I can't do it in front of all these people.”
「あのさ、ここでエッチしない？」=“Hey, do you want to have sex in here?”
「もう、どーなっても知らんよー？　誰か来たらやめてねー？」=“I don't care what happens, okay?　I don't care what happens. If someone comes, don't do it, okay?”
「その場の欲求で動き過ぎよー。自分もそういう所あるけど、キミ程じゃないさー」=“You're acting out of spur of the moment. I'm like that too, but not as much as you.”
「あのねぇ、自分……今でーじエッチしたくて……相手してくれるー？」=“Hey, I'm at ...... and I want to have sex with you. Can you do that for me?”
「えへ、たくさんしよねー？　自分、すぐにはきっと収まらないさー」=“I'm sure I won't be able to stop soon.　I'm sure it won't stop soon.”
「残念……今、自分としたら、絶対気持ち良かったと思うよー？」=“It's a shame. ...... I'm sure it would have felt so good to do it with you right now, wouldn't it?”
「一緒に観光しに行こうよ」=“Let's go sightseeing together.”
「おっけー。折角だし、いろんな所に行ってみたいさー！」=“Sure. I'd love to go sightseeing with you.”
「観光か～。今はそこまで行きたくないかね～」=“Sightseeing. I don't think I want to go that far right now.”
「ねぇねぇ、一緒に観光行こうねー？」=“Hey, hey, let's go sightseeing together, okay?”
「えへ、ありがとー。どこも楽しそうで、目移りするさー」=“Yes, thank you. Everything looks so fun, it's hard to choose.”
「なんでよー。キミと一緒に観光するの、楽しみしてたのにぃ……」=“Why not? I was looking forward to going sightseeing with you. ......”
「ねぇ、一緒に遊ばない？」=“Hey, do you want to hang out with me?”
「うん、遊びのお誘いならでーじ歓迎！　えへ、わくわくしてきたさー」=“Yeah, you're welcome to hang out with me!　Yeah, I'm excited.”
「遊ばー……ない。また今度誘ってー」=“No ....... Ask me again sometime.”
「あのねー。自分と一緒に、遊んでくれないー？」=“You know what? I want you to play with me.”
「いいの？　やった♪　でーじ嬉しいさー」=“Are you sure?　I'm so happy.”
「まさかやー。キミに断られるとは思ってなかったよー」=“No way. I didn't think you'd say no.”
「二人で色々体験したら、面白そうだと思わない？」=“Wouldn't it be fun if we could experience things together?”
「だからよー、それじゃあ何する？　自分は何でもいいからね」=“So, what do you want to do?　I'll do whatever you want.”
「んー、今は遠慮しておくさー。また今度ね」=“Hmm, I'll hold off for now. Maybe next time.”
「なんか珍しいこと体験したいねー。一緒にしたら絶対楽しいよー？」=“I want to experience something unusual. It'll be fun to do it with you.”
「よかったー♪　断られたら悲しくなってたよー」=“I'm glad. I would have been sad if you said no.”
「自分と一緒は嫌？　ちょっと寂しいねぇ……」=“You don't want to be with me?　It's a little lonely. ......”
「よかったら、ご飯食べに行かない？」=“Would you like to have dinner with me?”
「もちろんオッケーよー！　誰かと食べた方がご飯は美味しいからねー」=“Sure, why not!　Food tastes better when you eat it with someone else.”
「今はいいかなぁ。食べたいものが浮かばないやっさー」=“I don't know about now. I can't think of anything I want to eat.”
「ご飯、食べたいねぇ……キミも、食べたいよねぇ？」=“I want to eat. ...... You want to eat, too, don't you?”
「えへ、じゃあ決まり！　一緒に食べに行こー」=“Yeah, that's it!　Let's go eat together.”
「そっかー、お腹空いてたのは、自分だけみたいだねー」=“Well, it looks like I'm the only one who's hungry.”
「ちょっと付いてきてもらえる？」=“Can you come with me?”
「うん。どこ行くのー？　楽しいとこがいーねー」=“Sure. Where are we going?　I want to go somewhere fun.”
「今はちょっとー。他の子じゃダメなのー？」=“Not now. Can't we go with someone else?”
「はぁ、彼氏にそういう趣味があるなんて……どうしたもんかねー」=“I can't believe my boyfriend has that kind of taste. ...... I don't know what to do.”
「こらぁっ！　自分まで変なのと付き合ってると思われるよー。まったくぅ……」=“Oh, come on!　I don't know what to do. Oh, my God. ......”
「あぎじゃびよー！　もう、見たいなら言ってー。驚かさんでよ～」=“Aggijabiyo!　If you want to see it, just tell me. Don't scare me.”
「もうっ、なんで彼女がいるのに覗きなんてするかねー。自分が恥ずかしいさぁ……」=“I don't know why I'm peeping when I have a girlfriend. I'm ashamed of myself. ......”
「ん～、今はお話できないさー。ほんとにごめんねー、嫌いにならないでー」=“Hmm, I can't talk to you right now. I'm so sorry. Please don't hate me.”
「どう？　彼女の身体なんだから、どこもじょーとーだよねー？」=“What do you think?　It's her body, it's all right, isn't it?”
「うー、どれだけ見ても、皆がいる時はダメさー」=“No matter how much you look at it, you can't do it when everyone's around.”
「えへ、自分の水着姿はどう？　惚れ直してくれたー？」=“How do you like your own swimsuit?　Do you like it?”
「周りの女の子と比べるのは禁止よー？　彼女が一番でしょー？」=“Don't compare yourself to other girls, okay?　She's the best, isn't she?”
「もうここでいいのー？　まだまだ自分は歩けるよー」=“Are you sure you want to stay here?　I can still walk.”
「そこは入っちゃダーメ。ちゃんと注意してあげるのも、彼女の仕事だからねー」=“You can't go in there. It's her job to be careful, you know.”
「えへ、キミと一緒にいるだけで……なんかもう、幸せでぽかぽかするよー」=“You know, just being with you ...... makes me feel so happy and warm.”
「自分、今なら何でも許しちゃいそうかも……一緒にしたいこと、ない？」=“I think I can forgive anything now. ...... Is there anything you want to do with me?”
「はっさ、驚かさんでよ～。キミはヤナワラバーだね」=“You're a Janawaraber. You're a yarn lover.”
「はいたーい♪　えへ、もうこの挨拶にも慣れたー？」=“You're a Yanahuarabah. - Yes, I am. - Are you used to this greeting?”
「さーて、今日はなにしようかねー？　キミは何かあるー？」=“So, what shall we do today?　What do you have in mind?”
「えへへ、キミを見てると勝手に頬が緩んできて、困るねぇ」=“I can't help but feel my cheeks relax when I look at you.”
「最近、[H名]の訛りがうつってきた気がするさー」=“I think I'm starting to get that [H名] accent.”
「えへ、恋人同士は似るって言うからねー。二人でお揃い嬉しいさー」=“I think I'm getting [H名]'s accent these days." "Yeah, they say lovers look alike. I'm glad we're both wearing the same one.”
「うーん、まだまだよー。でも、段々似てくるのって、なんかいい感じねー」=“Well, not yet. But it's nice that we're becoming more alike.”
「恋人になる前と違って、話題選びで焦ることが減った気がする」=“I feel like I'm in less of a hurry to choose a topic than before we became lovers.”
「それ分かるー、自分もそうよー。お互い無言になっても全然気まずくないよねー」=“I know what you mean. I feel the same way. It's not awkward at all when we're silent.”
「自分はまだちょっと焦っちゃうねー。むしろ、ドキドキが強くなったかも……」=“I'm still a little impatient. I'm still a little impatient. I think my heart is pounding harder now. ......”
「この頃、何してても[H名]のこと考えちゃうんだよね」=“These days, I think about [H名] no matter what I'm doing.”
「えっ、キミもー？　自分もよー。いっつもキミが隣にいる気がするさー」=“What, you too?　Me too. I feel like you're next to me all the time.”
「あぅ、いきなりそんなこと言われると照れるさー。自分は……たまに考えるくらいよー？」=“Oh, I'm embarrassed to hear you say that. I only think about ...... once in a while.”
「恋人になって、なんか変わったことってある？」=“Has anything changed since we became lovers?”
「もちろんさー。色々あるけど、景色が輝いて見えるってほんとだったんだねー」=“Of course. Of course. There are many things, but it's true that the scenery looks brighter.”
「そこまで目立った変化はないかねぇ。一緒にいるだけで、もうでーじ幸せよー」=“I don't think there is any noticeable change. I'm so happy just being with you.”
「つまらんこと聞かんでー。彼女の趣味をもうちょっと理解して欲しいさー」=“Don't ask me boring questions. I want you to understand her taste a little better.”
「たまに、急に会いたくなる時って無い？」=“Do you ever have those moments when you just want to see her?”
「あるよー。たまにじゃなくて、いつも思ってる……えへへ」=“Yes, I do. Not sometimes, but all the time. ......”
「俺と恋人になって良かった？」=“Are you happy to be my girlfriend?”
「ありゃ、自信無くなっちゃったー？　えへ、もっと好き好き言わないとかねー？」="Oh, you're not so sure now, are you?　You need to say "I love you" more, don't you?
「恋は盲目って言うけどさ、ほんと[H名]が可愛くて仕方ないよ」=“They say love is blind, but I really can't help but think you're cute.”
「ふぁっ、いきなりなにー？　もう、顔が真っ赤になるよー」=“What?　Your face is turning red.”
「えへ、もう自分はキミの彼女なんだから。お世辞なんて言わなくていいのにー」=“Yeah, I'm your girlfriend now. You don't have to flatter me.”
「恋人になってからも、恋ってできるのかな？」=“Do you think we can still fall in love after we become lovers?”
「できるに決まってるよー。キミはちょっと難しく考え過ぎさー」=“Of course you can. You're thinking too hard.”
「たぶん、恋から愛に変わるのかもねぇ……自分はそう思うよー」=“Maybe love will change to love. ...... I think so.”
「もっと[H名]のことが知りたいな」=“I want to know more about you.”
「うん、自分もキミのことならなんでも知りたい。教えっこしようねー」=“Yeah, I want to know everything about you, too. Let's learn from each other.”
「もうほとんど知ってるはずよー？　キミには秘密にしてることないからー」=“You already know most of them.　I don't have any secrets from you.”
「恋人になったんだから、もっと[H名]と方言で喋れるようにならないとだよね？」=“Now that we're lovers, you'll have to learn to speak in [H名]'s dialect, right?”
「ゆっくり覚えてくれればいいさー。自分が全部教えてあげるからー」=“You can learn it slowly. I'll teach you everything I know.”
「そこまで気を使わなくていいさー。二人とも自然体が一番よー」=“You don't have to be so careful. It's best for both of you to be natural.”
「改めてそういう話をされると照れるねー。なんか違う話にしよー？」=“I'm embarrassed when you talk about it again. Let's talk about something else.”
「[H名]……好き！」=“I like [H名].......”
「えへへ、自分も好きよー。かなさんどー♪」=“I like it too. I like you too, Kana.”
「俺のこと、どれくらい好き？」=“How much do you like me?”
「もうでーじ好きよー。ちょっと言葉では表しきれんねー」=“I like you already. It's hard to put into words.”
「二人の子供ができたら、やっぱり少し訛った喋り方になるかな？」=“Do you think I'll have a slight accent when I have two kids?”
「あいっ！　子供！？　えっと……自分がママだから、たぶん訛るねー」=“Aww!　Kids?　Well, ...... I'm a mom, so I'll probably have an accent.”
「こ、子供が欲しいのー？　キミに似るだろうから、きっと訛らんさー」=“You want to have a baby?　I'll probably look like you, so I won't have an accent.”
「エッチが上手い男の方が……やっぱりいいよね？」=“It's ...... better to have a guy who's good at sex, isn't it?”
「それはまぁ……でも、キミになら何をされても、きっと気持ちよくなってしまうさー」=“Well, ......, but I'm sure whatever you do to me will make me feel better.”
「下手でも大丈夫よー。一番大事なのは気持ちさー」=“It's okay if you're not good at it. It doesn't matter if you're not good at it, what matters is how you feel.”
「彼氏にされる妄想でオナニーしたりする？」=“Do you masturbate to fantasies of your boyfriend doing things to you?”
「う、うん。だって、それが一番気持ちよくなれるからー……」=“No, I don't. Because that's what makes me feel the best. ......”
「し、してないーって言ったら、キミはちょっと寂しくなっちゃったりするー？」=“If I told you I don't masturbate, would you feel a little lonely?”
「恋人同士なんだから、エッチするのは普通だよね？」=“I mean, we're lovers, it's normal to have sex, right?”
「確かに変ではないけどー。あんまりそればっかりもダメよー？」=“It's not that weird. But you can't keep doing that.”
「普通かもしれんけど、特別なことよー。そこは間違わないでねー？」=“It may be normal, but it's special. It may be normal, but it's special. Don't make that mistake.”
「はぁ、親しき仲にもって言うよー。ちょっとムードが無さすぎさー」=“It's called being intimate. You're a little too moody for me.”
「[H名]って、エッチとかには抵抗無いタイプ？」=“Are you the type of guy who's not afraid of sex?”
「キミとならねー。誰とでもってわけじゃないから、ちゃんと覚えておいてー」=“With you, yes. With you, but not with everyone, so keep that in mind.”
「[H名]って、情熱的なエッチが好きそうだよね」=“You seem like the kind of guy who likes passionate sex.”
「情熱的ってどんなよー。まぁ、キミに激しく求められたら、嬉しくなっちゃうかもねー」=“What do you mean, "passionate"? Well, I think I'd be happy if you asked me hard.”
「あんまりジっと見てるとー、キスされるよー？　えへへ♪」=“Don't stare too long or you'll get a kiss.　Ha-ha-ha.”
「もう、キミはすぐしつこくするー。にらめっこの時間は終わりよー」=“Oh, you're so pushy. I'm done staring at you.”
「顔を見るだけじゃ何も分からんよー。ちゃんと言葉で伝えてー」=“You can't understand anything by just looking at me. You have to tell me.”
「えへ、いーよ。少しくらいなら胸見てもー。自分はキミの彼女だからねー」=“Sure, sure. You can look at my breasts if you want. I'm your girlfriend, you know.”
「もうっ、恋人になったからって、やりたい放題していいわけじゃないよー」=“Just because you're my girlfriend doesn't mean you can do whatever you want.”
「こらー、胸ばっかり見ないー。キミの視線は正直過ぎるさー」=“Don't stare at my breasts. Your eyes are too honest.”
「キミの手、あったかいねー。心までポカポカしてくるよー」=“Your hands are so warm. Your hands are so warm, they make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.”
「もうニギニギはお終い。手汗とかついちゃうよー？」=“No more nibbling. You're making my hands sweat.”
「手はねー、たまに握るからいいさーね。しつこいと逆効果よー」=“It's okay if you hold my hand once in a while. Don't be too pushy.”
「あ～、いけないんだ～。いくらキミの彼女だからって勝手に胸を触っちゃダメさー」=“Oh, I shouldn't do that. I know she's your girlfriend, but you can't touch her breasts without permission.”
「あぅ、変な気分になってきてるから……ほんとに胸はもうダメー」=“Oh, I'm starting to feel weird. ...... I really don't want to touch your breasts.”
「もう、人が見てたらどうするのー？　変態カップルだと思われちゃうよー」=“Oh my God, what if people see us?　They'll think we're a couple of perverts.”
「えへぇ～、キミにナデナデされると……なんかポワーっとするさー」=“Yeah, you're making me feel all ...... warm and fuzzy.”
「撫で過ぎさー。ありがたみが消えてしまうよー？」=“You're petting me too much. You're stroking me too much. You're making me ungrateful.”
「ナデナデばかりされると力抜けちゃうからー、その辺りにしといてー」=“If you keep nudging me, I'll lose my strength.”
「ほっぺ柔らかいー？　えへへ、キミにデレデレになってるからねー」=“Are your cheeks soft?　My cheeks are soft. I'm so horny for you.”
「ちょっとが一番ドキドキするんだよー？　キミにはそれを分かって欲しいなー」=“It's the little things that make me nervous.　I want you to know that.”
「むー、そんなにムニムニされたら、自分のほっぺが伸びてしまうさー」=“Mmm, you're making my cheeks stretch.”
「えへへ、惚れ直すってほんとにあるねー。今、そんな気分さー」=“It's true that you can fall in love all over again. That's what I'm feeling right now.”
「キミといると身体がポカポカしてきてー、もう熱いくらいよー」=“You're making me feel all warm and fuzzy, like I'm on fire.”
「まだ時間あるー？　できれば、もうちょっとお話したいさー」=“Do you have time?　I'd love to talk to you for a while.”
「何か考え事ー？　じゃあ自分は、ゆっくり待ってるねー」=“Are you thinking about something?　I'll just wait and see.”
「ぁ……もう行っちゃうのー？　もっとキミと、一緒に居たかったなぁ……」=“Oh, ......, you're leaving?　I wish I had more time with you. ......”
「あのね、この後ねぇ……やっぱり何でもない。気にしないでー」=“You know, after this, ...... it's nothing. Don't worry about it.”
「じゃ、バイバイねー。またいつでも話しかけてー」=“Well, bye bye. I'll talk to you anytime.”
「うぅ、ちょっと寂しい……なんて、彼氏さんを困らせちゃだめよねー」=“Ugh, I'm a little sad ......, don't embarrass your boyfriend.”
「さてさて、キミとお話できて楽しかったよー。それじゃ、気を付けてねー」=“Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you. Take care of yourself.”
「実は忙しかったー？　ちょっとでもお話してくれて、ありがとー」=“Have you been busy?　Thanks for taking the time to talk to me.”
「なんか慌ただしいねー。また今度、ゆっくりお話したいさー」=“It's been so hectic. I'd like to talk to you again sometime.”
「うん、いいよー。自分もね、またしたいと……思ってたんだー」=“Yeah, sure. I've been thinking about ...... doing it again, too.”
「その……ごめんねぇ、心の準備をさせてほしいさー」=“I'm sorry about the ......, but I need you to prepare yourself.”
「エッチ、したくないー？　自分は、したいんだけどなー」=“Do you want to have sex?　I'd love to.”
「えへ、恋人同士だもんね～♪　愛し合うのは当然のことさー」=“Well, we're lovers and we're supposed to love each other.”
「彼女からのお誘い、断っちゃうのー？　まぁいいけどー。ほんとは、よくないけどぉ……」=“Are you going to turn down her offer?　It's okay. It's not really a good idea. ......”
「今、ここでエッチしたいって言ったら……流石にダメかな？」=“Would it be wrong if I said I wanted to have sex with her right now?”
「大胆なこと、キミとならできそうさー。えへ、でーじドキドキするねー」=“I think I can do something daring with you. It's so exciting.”
「いくらキミとでも、いいよとは言えんねー。人に迷惑をかけちゃダメさー」=“I don't care if it's with you, I can't say no. I don't want to get you in trouble.”
「いいよ、今は誰もいないしねー。えへ、ちょっと自分、興奮してきてるかもー」=“It's okay, there's no one here right now. I think I'm getting a little excited.”
「中途半端になるのは嫌よー。するならもっとゆっくりできる所がいいさー」=“I don't want this to go halfway. If we're going to do this, we'd better do it somewhere more relaxing.”
「観光ね、いいよー。キミと一緒に回りたい所なら、いくらでもあるからー」=“Sightseeing, okay. There are so many places I'd like to visit with you.”
「一緒に観光しないー？　二人で回ったら絶対楽しいよー？」=“Why don't we go sightseeing together?　It would be fun to go sightseeing together.”
「にふぇーでーびる……ありがとー♪　道案内は任せてー。色々調べてあるからー」=“Thank you for ....... Leave the directions to me. I've done a lot of research.”
「えぇ、なんでよー。他の子と行くのー？　嫉妬されるよー？」=“Oh, why? Are you going with other girls?　You'll be jealous.”
「うんっ、あそぼあそぼ♪　キミとならどんな遊びも絶対楽しめるよー」=“Yes, let's play, let's play." "I'm sure you'll enjoy all the games.”
「あのねー、自分と遊んで欲しいなー。なんてー」=“You know what? I want you to play with me. Oh, my God.”
「やった。キミなら絶対、一緒に遊んでくれると思ってたさー」=“Yes. I knew you'd play with me. I knew you'd play with me.”
「そっかぁ、残念だけど諦めるさー。また……誘ってもいいよねー？」=“Oh, well, I'll give up, unfortunately. Can I ask you to go to ...... again?”
「体験て、キミが言うとちょっとエッチに聞こえるねぇ。でもいいよ、色々やってみよー」="Experience," you say, sounding a bit naughty. "Experience" sounds a bit naughty when you say it, but it's okay.
「ねーえー、体験コーナーに行ってみないー？　新しい発見があるかもしれんよー」=“Hey, why don't you go to the hands-on corner?　Maybe you'll find something new.”
「うんうん、そうと決まれば善は急げよー！　早く行こー」=“Yeah, well, once you've decided that, you'd better hurry up!　Let's go.”
「興味なかったー？　自分と行くのが嫌なわけじゃないよねー？」=“You're not interested?　It's not like you don't want to go with me, right?”
「うんうん！　とっても美味しいもの、二人で食べようねー」=“No!　We're going to have the most delicious food together.”
「キミと一緒にご飯食べたいなー。ダメかね―？」=“I want to have dinner with you. Can't we?”
「えへへ、嬉しいねー。お腹いっぱい食べ過ぎちゃいそうさー」=“I'm so happy. I think I'm going to eat too much.”
「そっかぁ、無理して食べると美味しいものも不味くなるからねぇ……仕方ないねぇ」=“Oh, well, if you force yourself to eat, even the best food will taste bad. ...... I don't blame you.”
「あのさ……俺の部屋に来ない？」=“Hey, ......, do you want to come to my room?”
「う、うん……いいよー。キミの部屋で、ゆっくりしよー」=“Yeah, ...... is fine. Let's relax in your room.”
「うーん、今すぐはねぇ……また後でも大丈夫？」=“Hmm, not right now. ...... Can we do it later?”
「[H名]、付いてきて」=“[H名], follow me.”
「また突然だねー。どこ行くかも言わないで付いてくの、自分くらいよー」=“It's so sudden. I'm the only one who follows you without telling you where we're going.”
うんうん、はぁーや、だーる、だーるやー=Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
うーん、そうかねー？、違うよー、えぇ……=Hmm, is that so? No, it's not. ......
だからよー、やさやさ、だー=It's just me.
あいっ、はっさみよー、あぎじゃびよー=It's a good thing you're here.
えへへ、んふー、やったー、えへぇ=Heh, heh, heh, yay, heh.
むー、なんでよー、はぁ……、もーいい=Moo, why, haha, ......, enough!
なんでー、辛いー、うぅ……、困ったねー=Why, it's so hard. ......, I'm in trouble.
えっへぇ、んへへ～、えへへ=Heh, heh, heh, heh.
あぅ、やーよー、だーめ、こらぁ……、うぅぅ……=Oh, no, no, no, no, come on, ......, ugh, ......
だー、ねぇ、えっとねー、そうだー、あのねー=Duh, hey, let's see... yeah, you know...
「ねぇ、[Hあだ名]。愛称で呼んでほしいな」=“Hey, [Hあだ名]. I'd like you to call me by my nickname.”
「えっ、あっ……[Pあだ名]。えへへ、やっぱりちょっと照れくさいねー」=“Oh, ......[Pあだ名]. I'm still a little embarrassed.”
「ねーえ、[Pあだ名]♪」=“Hey, [Pあだ名]”
「どうしたの？　[Hあだ名]」=“What's the matter? [Hあだ名].”
「えへぇ、大好き♪　かなさんどー♪」=“Yes, I love you." "Kana-san...”
「[Pあだ名]……そんなに自分とエッチがしたいんだー？　えへへ、仕方ないねぇ……」=“[Pあだ名]...... You want to have sex with me that badly?　Heh, I can't help it. ......”
「ねぇ[Pあだ名]……エッチ、しないー？　だめぇ？」=“Hey, [Pあだ名]......, do you want to have sex with me?　No?”
「はいたーい。えへへ、ちょっとお話に付き合ってほしいさー？」=“Yes, yes. I want to have a little chat with you.”
「[Pあだ名]、はいたーい。えへへ、ちょっとお話に付き合ってほしいさー？」=“[Pあだ名], yes. [Pあだ名], yes, I'd like to have a little chat with you.”
