「あっ……確かにそれっぽいかも！」=“Yeah, ...... sure sounds like it!”
「この前、ヤシガニを見つけたんだよ」=“I found a coconut crab the other day.”
「ヤシガニ……ワタシ、あれに良い印象はないんだなぁ」=“Palm crabs. ...... I don't have a good feeling about them.”
「どうして？　可愛い……とは言えないけど、変な生き物ではないよね？」=“Why?　They're not ...... cute, but they're not weird, are they?”
「どうしてと言われても困るけど……」=“I don't know why you're asking, but ......”
「なんとなく生理的に受け付けないですぞ。オタク的に」=“I don't know, I just don't get it. It's nerdy.”
「ふーん。良くわからないけど、苦手なものとかってあるもんね」=“Hmm. I don't know, but there are certain things I don't like.”
「月桃の花って知ってる？」=“Do you know what a peach blossom is?”

「ヤマネコって可愛いよね」=“Isn't the bobcat cute?”
「ちなみに猫派？　それとも犬派？」=“By the way, are you a cat person or a dog person?　Are you a cat person or a dog person?”
「うーん、どちらとも言えない派ですな」=“Well, I can't say I'm a cat person or a dog person.”
「ネコ耳にもイヌ耳にも、それぞれに良さがありますぞ」=“Cat ears and dog ears have their own merits.”
「え？　耳？」=“What?　Ears?”
「ワタシの一押しはうさ耳ですな。バニーガールとか萌えると思うんだなぁ」=“Rabbit ears are my first choice. I think they're great for bunny girls.”

「それで、あなたは何派ですかな？」=“So, what's your thing?”
「流れ星って、何か名前からして格好いいよね」=“A shooting star is a cool name, isn't it?”
「わかりみが深いですぞ！　流れ星、いいですなぁ」=“That's very interesting!　I like shooting stars.”

「それは、３ｋｇくらいの重さがあるとかないとか」=“I heard it weighed about three kilograms.”
「あれ？　思ったよりも重くない……？」=“What?　It's not as heavy as I thought it would be. ......?”
「カメの重量の３０％くらいが甲羅の重さなので、重い奴はヤバいですな」=“About 30% of a turtle's weight is its shell, so a heavy turtle would be in trouble.”
