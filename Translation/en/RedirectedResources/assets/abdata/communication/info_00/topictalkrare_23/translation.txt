「ホエールウォッチングができるって聞いたんだ」=“Apparently, we can do whale watching here.”
「ああ、ワタシも聞いたことがあるよ」=“Aah, I've heard of that too.”
「一度、クジラが水上にジャンプするところを見てみたいんだなぁ」=“I wanna see a whale leaping out of water just once in my life~”
「あれに興味あるの？」=“You into that?”
「あれって召喚魔法っぽいと思いませんか？」=“Do you not think it looks similar to summoning magic?”
「あっ……確かにそれっぽいかも！」=“Ah--... you're right, it kinda does!”
「この前、ヤシガニを見つけたんだよ」=“The other day, I came across a coconut crab.”
「ヤシガニ……ワタシ、あれに良い印象はないんだなぁ」=“Coconut crabs... I don't have much of a good impression of those, you know?”
「どうして？　可愛い……とは言えないけど、変な生き物ではないよね？」=“Why? Cute... is not the word I'd choose for them, but they're not exactly weird either, are they?”
「どうしてと言われても困るけど……」=“I'm not sure how to answer, honestly...”
「なんとなく生理的に受け付けないですぞ。オタク的に」=“My gut just won't let me accept their existence. My inner otaku.”
「ふーん。良くわからないけど、苦手なものとかってあるもんね」=“Hmm. I don't really get it but, I guess everyone has things they don't like.”
「月桃の花って知ってる？」=“Do you know shell gingers?”
「一応知ってるよ。でも、あまり興味はないかなぁ」=“I know of them. But, can't say I'm really into them.”
「ワタシは美容関連のものより、ブルーレイとかを買いたいので」=“I'm more into spending my cash onto things like blu-rays than on things that look pretty.”
「でも、あの香りはなかなか清涼感があって良いと思うよ」=“But, their scent is really refreshing, you should try it sometime.”
「へぇ……そんなに言うなら、ちょっと興味があるかも……」=“Heh... You're being so insistent, now I feel a bit interested too...”
「今度なにかで試してみたら良いんじゃないかな」=“You really should try to get a wiff of that scent yourself somehow.”
「ヤマネコって可愛いよね」=“Wildcats are really cute, aren't they?”
「ちなみに猫派？　それとも犬派？」=“Incidentally, are you a cat person? Or a dog person?”
「うーん、どちらとも言えない派ですな」=“Nnnn, more of a both person, I'd say.”
「ネコ耳にもイヌ耳にも、それぞれに良さがありますぞ」=“Both cat ears and dog ears have their own charm, you know.”
「え？　耳？」=“Eh? Ears?”
「ワタシの一押しはうさ耳ですな。バニーガールとか萌えると思うんだなぁ」=“Personally, I'm more of a bunny ears girl, really. Bunny girls really get me fired up, you know?”
「コスプレの話！？」=“Wait, we're talking about cosplay here?!”
「それで、あなたは何派ですかな？」=“So then, what about you? Which side are you on?”
「流れ星って、何か名前からして格好いいよね」=“Shooting stars kinda sound cool just from their name, don't they?”
「わかりみが深いですぞ！　流れ星、いいですなぁ」=“I get ya! They're so nice~”
「必殺技の名前にも良いし、二つ名でも良し」=“It sounds great for a killer move, or a character's pseudonym too.”
「アニメやマンガのタイトルにも使われることが多いですぞ！」=“It's often used in anime and manga titles too!”
「まぁ、人名に使うとキラキラネームになっちゃうけどね」=“Well, as someone's actual name it'd sound pretty 'unique' though.”
「ああいうのは二次元だから許されるのであって、三次元だと……お察しですな」=“It works in media only because it's 2D, in 3D it'd be... very 'unique', yeah.”
「でも、格好いい人には似合うのはズルいと思う」=“But, I think it's pretty unfair how a really cool person could get away with it.”
「一夜で散っちゃうサガリバナって知ってる？」=“Do you know of those mango pines, that wilt after just one night?”
「一夜？　それはずいぶんと儚い花だね」=“Just one night? That's a very transient flower.”
「でも、そういうのはゲームで重要アイテムになりそうなんだなぁ」=“But, that sounds like just the sort of thing that'd make for key item in a videogame.”
「ああ、なんかありそうだね。花言葉は確か……幸運が訪れるだったかな」=“Aah, you're right. In flower language, it was... "brings fortune", if I remember right?”
「ますますそれっぽい感じに……絶対次のクエストに進む為のキーアイテムですぞ」=“It's feeling more and more like it's from a game now... like the sort of item you need to proceed the main quest.”
「でも一夜で散るから、入手の条件がシビアそうだね」=“But it wilts after just one night, so I bet finding one's gonna be a journey in and of itself.”
「一理ある……そうなると、トゥルーエンドを見る為のアイテムかな？」=“You're not wrong... in that case, maybe it'd be the key to the true end?”
「お、それが一番しっくりくるかも……って、話がだいぶそれが気がするな」=“Ah, that might be a perfect fit for it... wuh, I think we've sidetracked quite a bit there.”
「見守っていた鳥の卵が孵ったんだよ」=“This bird egg I've been watching over finally hatched.”
「ほほう、鳥の雛が産まれた……と」=“Hohoh, a little chicked hatched... huh?”
「それでその雛に名前はつけたのかい？」=“Did you give it a name, then?”
「いや、飼うわけじゃないからつけたりはしないよ」=“No, it's not like I'm gonna keep it as a pet or anything, so I'm not gonna do that.”
「それは残念。どうせなら格好いい名前をつけたかったですぞ」=“That's a shame. You should have given it a really cool name, for all your trouble.”
「格好いい……か。例えばどんな名前？」=“A cool name... huh? For example, what kind of name?”
「フェニックス！　サンダーバード！」=“Phoenix! "Thunderbird"!”
「なんか無駄に強そう！？」=“Don't those sound needlessly strong?!”
「この前、水をあげてたアサガオが花をつけたんだよ」=“The other day, this morning glory I've been watering finally bloomed.”
「アサガオとは懐かしい……夏休みの宿題の定番ですなぁ」=“That's so nostalgic... that's the standard summer vacation assignment they give to kids, isn't it?”
「観察日記とかつけたよね。途中で枯らしちゃったり」=“I even remember the observation diaries. The plants tended to dry out and die a lot too, didn't they?”
「そう考えると、今回は良く咲かせられたなぁ……」=“Thinking about that, I'm surprised it bloomed so easily this time...”
「あれは普通に育てていれば、普通に花をつけますぞ……？」=“If you water them properly, those plants grow up just fine, you know...?”
「それを枯らすって、どれだけ適当な……」=“Just how careless do you have to be, to get one of those to dry up...”
「ま、まだ、あのときは子供だったから！　ははは」=“I-I was still, you know, I was still a kid back then! Hahahah.”
「マンタって、デカいよね……」=“Mantas are really big, aren't they...”
「世界最大のエイですからなぁ、デカくて当然なんだなぁ」=“They're the biggest rays you can find, afterall, it's normal for them to be that big.”
「知っているかい？　ドデカい奴は横幅が８メートルくらいあるのですぞ」=“Did you know? The biggest ones get as big as 8 meters wide.”
「えっ、そうなの！？」=“Eh--, really?!”
「いや……え？　それってデカすぎない……？」=“No, wait... eh? Isn't that a bit too big though...?”
「走り幅跳びの女子の世界記録では飛び越えられませんな」=“Even the world record holder for women's running long jump can't jump over that one.”
「よく世界記録を知ってたね。いやしかし……怪獣みたいなサイズだなぁ」=“I'm surprised you know the record for that. Still... that's almost a monster-tier size.”
「海ほたるって、水面がきらきら光って綺麗だよね」=“The way sea fireflies glitter in the water is just so pretty, isn't it?”
「ほたると言うだけあって、幻想的な光景ですな」=“It's a very fantastical sight, isn't it? I suppose that's fireflies for you.”
「まぁ、あまり海ほたるが出てる最中に海に入りたいと思わないけど……」=“Well, not that I'd want to go into the water while they're out doing their thing...”
「どうして？　自分の周りが光ってて良いと思うんだけど」=“Why? It'd look pretty nice, I think. Your surroundings would be glittering.”
「いやいや辺り一面生き物だらけなんだよ？　正直ゾっとするんだなぁ……」=“No way, you'd be surrounded by living 'things' on all sides, you know? Honestly, it sounds horrifying...”
「あぁ……そう言われるとなんとなくわかるよ」=“Aah... I feel like I get it, when you put it like that.”
「俺も生き物の群れに突っ込む勇気はないなぁ……」=“I don't think I'd have the courage to just jump into a herd like that either...”
「ウミガメの甲羅って、すごく重そうだよね」=“Sea turtle shells seem like they'd be really heavy, don't they?”
「どこかに、ウミガメの甲羅を背負えるコーナーあった気がしますぞ」=“I feel like there was a place around here somewhere where you could try wearing one yourself.”
「それは、３ｋｇくらいの重さがあるとかないとか」=“I think one weighed about 3 kilograms?”
「あれ？　思ったよりも重くない……？」=“Huh? That's not as heavy as I thought...”
「カメの重量の３０％くらいが甲羅の重さなので、重い奴はヤバいですな」=“A turtle's body weight is 30% just its shell so, can't make them much heavier than that.”
「それこそ背負って修行すると人間をやめられそうですぞ」=“Bet you could quit being human if you trained while wearing one on your back.”
「マンガでありがちな修行シーンだね！」=“Now that sounds like straight out of a manga!”
「星の砂って、やっぱり女の子は好きなのかな？」=“I guess girls really do like starsand?”
「可愛いから嫌いって娘はあまりいないと思うよ」=“I don't think you're gonna find any girls that hate it for its cuteness, for sure.”
「だからこそ、定番のお土産で売っているんだなぁ」=“That's probably why you can find it in just about every souvenir shop.”
「思ったんだけど、あれってマキビシにできないかな？」=“I've been thinking though, can't you use those as caltrops?”
「……その発想はなかったですぞ」=“...I've never thought about it that way, no.”
「忍者ごっこができるなら、男の子にも人気が出そうだね」=“I bet they could sell lots of them to boys too, if they marketed them as a ninja tool.”
「ウムイの鐘を鳴らしたら結ばれるって話を聞いて思ったんだけどさ」=“So, I heard that if you ring the bell of Umuy together, fate will lead to you being tied together someday, and I've been thinking.”
「逆に、絶対に別れられる鐘って需要はないかな？」=“Do you think there'd be any market demand for a bell that'd fate you for a future breakup?”
「何だい、その呪われそうな設定の鐘は」=“That sounds like a curse from a horror novel.”
「縁切りの神社とかあるし、悪くないと思ったんだよ」=“I mean, there's even a god of separation so, I don't think it's that bad of an idea.”
「そう言われれば、アリな気もしますな……」=“When you put it like that, I suppose it could work...”
「ロマンチックの欠片もないので、観光地的には需要は無いと思うけど」=“It's not romantic at all though, so I don't think there would be much tourist demand, for sure.”
「だよね。やっぱりダメか……」=“Right. I guess that one's a no go...”
「母性が一番現れる場所って、おっぱいだと思うんだ」=“I think boobs are where a girl's motherly qualities show themselves the best.”
「そういう小さな人を敵に回す発言はどうかと思うよ？」=“You sure you want to go antagonizing women with smaller busts there?”
「小さなおっぱいにだって、希少価値がありますからなぁ」=“There's value in the lack of size too, you know.”
「むしろ、ステータスだと誇っても良いくらいですぞ！」=“Really, I do think having a smaller chest is part of one's status, something worth being proud of!”
「それも一理ある……。おっぱいは奥が深いね」=“You've got a point... Boobs truly are deep.”
「フェチについて思ったんだけど、コスプレって良いよね……」=“As far as fetishes go, cosplays are pretty nice for that, aren't they...”
「男の人って、メイドとかナースとかが好きなイメージがありますなぁ」=“Men do love their maid and nurse cosplays, don't they?”
「やっぱり、あなたも好きなのかい？」=“Do you love them too?”
「どちらかと言えば、コスチュームよりも中身派ではあるけど……」=“I mean, I'm more of an 'what matters is on the inside' kinda guy but...”
「中身が良ければ、外側もいろいろ試したいよね！」=“If the inside is good, a bit of variety on the outside can't hurt!”
「はぁ……全く。まぁ、一理あることは否定はしませんが……」=“Haah... good grief. Well, I won't deny that you do have a point...”
「ねぇ、欲求不満のときにオナニーする？」=“Hey, do you masturbate when you feel sexually frustrated?”
「えーと……ド直球でそんなこと聞かれても、正直に言って返答に困りますぞ」=“Erhm... I'm impressed by how direct you're being but, I'll be honest, I have no idea how to answer that.”
「ま、まぁ、あえて答えるなら……する時もあれば、しないこともあるって感じになりますな」=“W-Well, I mean, if I really had to... "sometimes" is what I can give you.”
「なんか中途半端な答えだね、それ」=“That's a very half assed answer, you know.”
「ワタシにはゲームがあるので、それで欲求不満も解消できますぞ！」=“I have more than enough games in my backlog, so I just play those to forget about it!”
「ああ……なるほどね。それもありか」=“Aah... I see. I guess that works too.”
「初めてのエッチのときってどうだったのかな？」=“How was our first time for you?”
「痛かった」=“It hurt.”
「……それだけ？」=“...Really? Nothing else?”
「それだけっていうけど、ぶっといナニを差し込まれるのですぞ」=“You know that it involved your huge thing spreading me apart from the inside, right?”
「一度、あなたもお尻で経験してみたら、実感できるのでは？」=“How about we try it with your butt too, maybe that'll evoke some sympathy?”
「うっ……それは遠慮しておくよ。想像だけでヤバそうだし」=“Uu--... I'll pass. Just imagining it is plenty graphic for me.”
「まぁ……最終的に気持ち良くなれたし、あなたが優しくしてくれたのは伝わって来たんだなぁ」=“Well... by the end it did start feeling great, and I could tell you were being as gentle as you could, so~”
「そっか……ならよかった」=“I see... glad to hear that then.”
