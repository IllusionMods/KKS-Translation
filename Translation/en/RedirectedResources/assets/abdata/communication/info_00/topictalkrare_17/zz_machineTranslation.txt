「案内板で知ったんだけど、ホエールウォッチングが出来るみたいだよ」=“I found out from the information board that you can go whale watching there.”
「へぇ。クジラを見に行くのも面白そうね」=“Oh, yeah. It's interesting to see whales.”
「船よりも大きかったりするのかな？　すごい迫力だろうなぁ」=“I wonder if they're bigger than ships.　I bet they're really impressive.”
「ふふっ、そんなに大きいなら、体当たりで簡単に船が沈んじゃいそうね？」=“Hmm, if they're that big, they'd easily sink the boat if they hit you, wouldn't they?”
「少なくとも濡れる覚悟だけはしておいた方が良いかもしれないわ」=“You might want to at least be prepared to get wet.”
「実はヤシガニを見つけたんだ」=“Actually, I found a coconut crab.”
「ヤシガニ……って、美味しいのかしら？」=“I wonder if coconut crabs ...... are any good?”
「いや、絶滅危惧種なんだし食べるのはどうかと思うんだけど……」=“No, they're an endangered species and I don't think you should eat them. ......”
「冗談よ。それに、ヤシガニは毒を持ってることもあるそうだし」=“I'm kidding. I'm kidding. - Besides, I heard that coconut crabs can be poisonous.”
「でも、この島にもヤシガニがいるのね。見に行こうかしら」=“But there are coconut crabs on this island. Maybe we should go see them.”
「そういえば、このまえ月桃の話を聞いたんだ」=“Oh, by the way, I heard about moonberries the other day.”
「月桃というと……美容用品にも使われている花だったわよね？」=“Isn't the moonflower a flower that is used in ...... beauty products?”
「独特な香りだけど、アロマオイルも人気だって聞いたことがあるわ」=“It has a unique scent, but I've heard it's popular as an aromatic oil.”
「独特すぎて、俺としてはちょっと苦手な香りかも」=“I've heard it's popular as an aromatic oil, though it's too unique a scent for me.”
「ふふっ、それならあなたみたいな男を追い払う──虫除けにちょうど良さそうね」=“Hmm, that sounds like a good insect repellent to keep men like you away.”
「たまたま散歩してたら、ヤマネコを発見したんだ！」=“I just happened to be out for a walk and spotted a bobcat!”
「そうなの？　人前にも出てきてたりするのね」=“Oh, yeah?　Oh, yeah? They've been known to show up in public.”
「ヤマネコって思いのほか人懐っこいのかしら？」=“Do you think bobcats are more friendly than we think?”
「いや……さすがに手を出せば、引っかかれると思うよ」=“No. ...... I'm sure they'd scratch you if you tried to touch them.”
「そう。それは残念だわ」=“Yeah. That's too bad.”
「思う存分もふもふできれば楽しいと思ったのに……」=“I thought it would be fun to fluff them up as much as I could. ......”
「でも、見ているだけでも可愛かったよ」=“But it was pretty to look at.”
「流れ星って、なんだかロマンチックだよね」=“Shooting stars are kind of romantic, aren't they?”
「ええ、そうね。でも、それがどうしたの？」=“Yes, they are. Yeah, they are. What's wrong with that?”
「いや、空を光が横切るように星が流れるのが不思議に思えてさ」=“No, it's just that it's strange to see the stars moving across the sky like lights.”
「そうね……流星雨なんて、空一面で光が走るんだし、不思議と言えば不思議ね」=“Well, a ...... meteor shower is a strange thing to see, with all the light in the sky.”
「でもまぁ、流れ星なんて大気圏で燃え尽きる塵でしかないんだけど」=“But then again, shooting stars are nothing but dust that burns up in the atmosphere.”
「そう言われると一気にロマンがなくなるね……」=“That makes it all the less romantic. ......”
「なんであれ、綺麗であればそれで良いってことだと思うわ」=“I guess whatever is beautiful is good enough for me.”
「この前、サガリバナを見かけたんだよ」=“I saw a sagebrush the other day.”
「あの、一夜で散ってしまうっていう花……よね？」=“It's a flower that falls apart in a night. ......”
「南の島の風物詩らしいし、儚くも綺麗なのよね」=“They say it's a tradition on the southern islands. It's beautiful, but fleeting.”
「もっとも、線香花火と大差ないような気もするけど」=“But I don't think they're all that different from sparklers.”
「どっちも儚くて綺麗な代名詞だしね」=“They're both synonymous with transience and beauty.”
「美人薄命ともいうし、私もその仲間かしら？」=“Do you think I'm one of them?”
「うーん、綺麗なのは否定しないけど、儚いかは……どうだろう」=“Well, I don't deny they're beautiful, but I don't know if they're ...... fragile.”
「聞いてよ、ずっと見守ってた、鳥の雛がようやく孵ったんだ！」=“Listen, the bird I've been watching so closely has finally hatched!”
「あら、それは良かったわね」=“Oh, that's great.”
「よく長い間、見続けていたわね？　暇だったの？」=“How did you manage to keep your eyes open for so long?　Did you have a lot of time on your hands?”
「どうしても気になっちゃってさ。無事、卵から孵れるのって思っちゃって」=“I was just curious. I was wondering if it would ever hatch from the egg.”
「それは少し同意できるわ。でも、その雛も可哀想。あなたが親代わりになるんだから……」=“I agree with you a little. But I also feel sorry for the chicks. I feel sorry for them, because you're going to be their parent. ......”
「さすがに刷り込みはしてないよ？　少しだけ誘惑に駆られちゃったけどさ」=“I'm not imprinting on them, okay?　I was a little tempted, though.”
「ずっと水をあげてたら、ようやくアサガオが咲いたんだよ」=“I've been watering it all day and the morning glory has finally bloomed.”
「ご苦労さま。あなたって結構マメな性格なのね？」=“Thanks for your help. You're a pretty diligent person, aren't you?”
「いや、花が咲いたら華やかだろうなって思ってただけなんだけどね」=“No, I just thought it would be gorgeous when it bloomed.”
「また花が咲いたら、見に行ってみてよ」=“When they bloom again, you'll have to go and see.”
「そうね。気が向いたら行ってみるわ」=“Yes, I will. I'll go when I feel like it.”
「アサガオ自体にはさほど興味は無いんだけれど……」=“I'm not really interested in the morning glory, but ......”
「あなたの努力の成果には、ちょっとだけ興味があるから」=“I'm a little more interested in the fruits of your labor.”
「マンタってちょっと変わってるよね」=“Manta rays are kind of weird, aren't they?”
「あの平べったい体型はなかなか愛嬌があるわね」=“Their flat bodies are quite charming.”
「もし水上に跳び上がりでもしたら、そのまま飛んで行くんじゃないかしら？」=“If they jumped up out of the water, they'd just fly away, wouldn't they?”
「ああいう飛行機とかありそうかも！」=“Maybe there could be a plane like that!”
「まあ、体重がものすごく重いから飛べないとは思うけど……」=“Well, I don't think he could fly because he weighs so much. ......”
「いや、自力で２メートルくらい跳ね上がれるらしいよ」=“No, they can jump up to two meters on their own.”
「集団で跳んでる映像とか調べればあったはず……すごいよね」=“I'm sure you can find some footage of them jumping in groups. ...... It's amazing.”
「実はさ、海ほたるを見ることが出来たんだ」=“Actually, I did get to see a sea firefly.”
「海上を輝きながら漂う光景は幻想的だよね」=“It's a fantastic sight to see them glowing and drifting across the ocean.”
「でも、実態をマジマジとみたらグロテスクよね……」=“But if you really look at them, they're grotesque. ......”
「あれって雑食性で何でも食べるらしいし」=“I heard they're omnivorous and eat everything.”
「うっ……そんなロマンのないことを言わなくたって……」=“Ugh. ...... You don't have to say such unromantic things. ......”
「私は正しい知識を教えただけよ」=“I'm just telling you what you need to know.”
「この前、ウミガメを見かけたんだ」=“I saw a sea turtle the other day.”
「この島はけっこう観光客が多いと思うけど、それでも来るものなのね」=“I think there are a lot of tourists on this island, but they still come.”
「やっぱり、ウミガメって産卵のときは涙を流すのかしら」=“I wonder if sea turtles shed tears when they lay their eggs.”
「さすがに産卵は見られなかったな」=“I didn't see any laying eggs.”
「そうなの？　産卵以外では陸上にあがらないんじゃなかった？」=“Really?　I thought they didn't come on land except to lay eggs.”
「じゃあ、タイミングが悪かったのかな……」=“Well, maybe it was bad timing. ......”
「砂浜の砂って、本当に星の形をしてるんだね」=“The sand on the beach really is shaped like stars, isn't it?”
「南の島の名物よね。でも、砂浜でも取れるのに売店で売ってるなんて……」=“It's a specialty of the southern islands. It's a specialty of the South Island, but I can't believe they sell it at the store when you can get it at the beach. ......”
「自分で採取すればただで手に入るってことよね？」=“If you collect it yourself, you can get it for free, right?”
「たしか、採取が禁止されてたと思うよ。許可がないとダメだって」=“I think it's forbidden to collect them. You have to have a permit.”
「サンゴは聞いたことあったけど、星の砂については知らなかったわ。意外と博識なのね」=“I've heard of coral, but I've never heard of star sand. I've heard of coral, but I've never heard of star sand. You're quite knowledgeable.”
「ウムイの鐘って、どうしてカップルが結ばれるって言われてるんだろ？」=“Why is the Umui Bell supposed to bring couples together?”
「見た目と、男女が２人で鳴らすからじゃないかしら？」=“I think it's because of the way they look and the fact that a man and a woman ring them together.”
「ウェディングベルってあるでしょ？　それにあやかったんじゃないかって思うわ」=“You know what wedding bells are?　I think it's a nod to that.”
「なるほど……そういう考え方もあるのか」=“I see. ...... That's one way of thinking about it.”
「実際はどうなのかはわからないけど、調べてみても面白いかもしれないわね」=“I don't know what it actually is, but it would be interesting to find out.”
「そうだね。観光ガイドとかに載ってるかもしれないし、確認してみるよ」=“I guess so. I'll check it out. It might be in a tourist guide or something.”
「おっぱいって、男のロマンがたくさん詰まってると思うんだ……」=“I think there's a lot of male romance in breasts. ......”
「……いきなり何を言ってるの、あなた？」=“...... What are you talking about all of a sudden, honey?”
「そんなにおっぱいが好きなら、自分の胸でも触っていればいいじゃない」=“If you like boobs so much, why don't you just touch your own breasts?”
「違うんだ！　自分のじゃ……ロマンを感じないんだよ……！」=“No, I'm not!　I don't feel ...... romantic with my own. ......!”
「訳が分からないわ……。変態なの？」=“I don't understand, ....... Are you a pervert?”
「うっ……ごめん。ちょっと興奮しすぎたよ……」=“Ugh. ...... Sorry. I got a little overexcited. ......”
「特殊なエッチって、すごく興奮すると思わない？」=“Don't you think special kind of sex is very exciting?”
「ずいぶんと唐突ね……。その内容自体は否定はしないけど」=“That's very abrupt ....... I'm not denying the content.”
「あなたを弄って遊ぶのは面白そうだし……？」=“I think it would be fun to play with you. ......?”
「とかいって、本当は自分が弄られる方が好きとか……」=“But you're saying you prefer to be played with. ......”
「そ、そんなわけないじゃない。本当にあなたは変態ねっ」=“No, of course not. You really are a pervert.”
「ひ、ひどい。でも、否定できないのが悔しい……」=“Oh, my God. But I'm sorry I can't deny it. ......”
「ちょっと聞いてみたいんだけど、欲求不満のときってどうしてるの？」=“Let me ask you something. What do you do when you're frustrated?”
「……いきなり何を聞いてくるのよ、あなたは」=“...... What are you asking me out of the blue, you know?”
「でも、そうね。強いて言えば……自分で解消したりするかしら」=“But, yes. If I had to guess, I'd say I relieve myself at .......”
「自分で！？　そ、そうなんだ……」=“By yourself?　Oh, yeah. ......”
「ふふっ、何を想像したの？　私は運動でもして解消するって言ったつもりなんだけど？」=“Hmm, what did you imagine?　I thought I said I could get rid of it by exercising.”
「あっ……う、運動だね。はは、もちろんわかってたとも！　はははは」=“Oh ......, exercise. Haha, of course I knew that!　Hahahahaha.”
「初めてエッチした時さ……大丈夫だった？　痛くなかったかな？」=“The first time you had sex, did it ...... hurt?　Did it hurt?”
「ええ、大丈夫……なわけが無いじゃない。血が出たのに」=“Yeah, it couldn't have ...... hurt. I was bleeding.”
「もう……デリカシーがないわね。見たらわかるでしょう」=“You ...... have no sense of humor. You should have seen it.”
「うっ、ごめん……」=“Ugh, I'm sorry. ......”
「でも、気遣ってくれたのはお礼を言うわ。その……あ、ありが……」=“But I thank you for your concern. Thank you for that ....... Oh, thank you .......”
「やっぱ、何でもない！　ふんっ、ヘタクソ」=“It's nothing!　You're such an asshole.”
「ぐはっ、そ、そんなひねくれたこと言わなくたって良いじゃないか」=“Oh, come on, you don't have to be so cynical.”
「ヘタクソは、地味にダメージがデカいよ……」=“You don't have to be so cynical. You know, a bad ass can do a lot of damage, .......”
