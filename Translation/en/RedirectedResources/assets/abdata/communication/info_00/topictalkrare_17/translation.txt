「案内板で知ったんだけど、ホエールウォッチングが出来るみたいだよ」=“I only just saw this on the information board but, apparently we can do whale watching here.”
「へぇ。クジラを見に行くのも面白そうね」=“Hoh. That sounds pretty interesting.”
「船よりも大きかったりするのかな？　すごい迫力だろうなぁ」=“Do you think it'd be bigger than the ship? I bet it's gonna be a real sight to look at.”
「ふふっ、そんなに大きいなら、体当たりで簡単に船が沈んじゃいそうね？」=“Fufuh--, if whales were that big, they'd be able to sink ships with just a body slam, you know?”
「少なくとも濡れる覚悟だけはしておいた方が良いかもしれないわ」=“At the very least, we'd best be prepared to get wet if nothing else.”
「実はヤシガニを見つけたんだ」=“I actually came across a coconut crab.”
「ヤシガニ……って、美味しいのかしら？」=“A coconut crab... I wonder, do they taste good?”
「いや、絶滅危惧種なんだし食べるのはどうかと思うんだけど……」=“They're endangered species so I really don't know about eating them...”
「冗談よ。それに、ヤシガニは毒を持ってることもあるそうだし」=“I'm joking. Not to mention, seems like sometimes they can have poison in them.”
「でも、この島にもヤシガニがいるのね。見に行こうかしら」=“But, even this island has them, huh? Maybe I'll go look at them.”
「そういえば、このまえ月桃の話を聞いたんだ」=“Reminds me, someone told me about shell gingers the other day.”
「月桃というと……美容用品にも使われている花だったわよね？」=“Shell gingers... you mean those flowers they use to make cosmetics, right?”
「独特な香りだけど、アロマオイルも人気だって聞いたことがあるわ」=“They've got a really unique scent to them, I've heard of them being used to make aroma oils too.”
「独特すぎて、俺としてはちょっと苦手な香りかも」=“It's a bit too unique for me, personally.”
「ふふっ、それならあなたみたいな男を追い払う──虫除けにちょうど良さそうね」=“Fufuh--, then it might be just perfect as insect repellent, to chase away men like you.”
「たまたま散歩してたら、ヤマネコを発見したんだ！」=“I was just taking a walk when I came across a wildcat!”
「そうなの？　人前にも出てきてたりするのね」=“Really? So they don't mind showing themselves to people, huh?”
「ヤマネコって思いのほか人懐っこいのかしら？」=“I wonder if they're actually pretty friendly animals?”
「いや……さすがに手を出せば、引っかかれると思うよ」=“I really don't think so... you'd probably get clawed if you tried to get close to one.”
「そう。それは残念だわ」=“I see. That's a shame.”
「思う存分もふもふできれば楽しいと思ったのに……」=“It'd have been a lot of fun to floof one up into a fluffy ball of fur too.”
「でも、見ているだけでも可愛かったよ」=“It was still really adorable to look at though.”
「流れ星って、なんだかロマンチックだよね」=“Shooting stars are kinda really romantic, aren't they?”
「ええ、そうね。でも、それがどうしたの？」=“Yes, they are. But, what about them?”
「いや、空を光が横切るように星が流れるのが不思議に思えてさ」=“No well, I just thought how amazing a sight it actually is, it's like a ray of light crossing the sky.”
「そうね……流星雨なんて、空一面で光が走るんだし、不思議と言えば不思議ね」=“Yeah... especially meteor showers, they cover just a single part of the sky in light, 'amazing' really is the only word for it.”
「でもまぁ、流れ星なんて大気圏で燃え尽きる塵でしかないんだけど」=“But well, at the end of the day, shooting stars are nothing but grains of rubbish burning up in the atmosphere.”
「そう言われると一気にロマンがなくなるね……」=“You made the romance of it all evaporate in one fell swoop...”
「なんであれ、綺麗であればそれで良いってことだと思うわ」=“I think as long as it makes for a pretty sight, the rest doesn't matter though.”
「この前、サガリバナを見かけたんだよ」=“The other day, I came across some mango pines.”
「あの、一夜で散ってしまうっていう花……よね？」=“You mean those, flowers only bloom for one night and then wither... right?”
「南の島の風物詩らしいし、儚くも綺麗なのよね」=“They're such a unique example of the south. So pretty and transient, you know?”
「もっとも、線香花火と大差ないような気もするけど」=“Of course, I feel like they're pretty similar to sparklers in that way.”
「どっちも儚くて綺麗な代名詞だしね」=“Both are pretty short lived and beautiful, aren't they?”
「美人薄命ともいうし、私もその仲間かしら？」=“They do say that the beautiful die young so, would I count as one of those too?”
「うーん、綺麗なのは否定しないけど、儚いかは……どうだろう」=“Nnnn, I won't deny that you're really pretty but, transient... yeah I dunno.”
「聞いてよ、ずっと見守ってた、鳥の雛がようやく孵ったんだ！」=“Listen to this, this bird egg I've been watching over finally hatched!”
「あら、それは良かったわね」=“Oh, good for you.”
「よく長い間、見続けていたわね？　暇だったの？」=“You must have spent a lot of time doing that, no? Were you that bored?”
「どうしても気になっちゃってさ。無事、卵から孵れるのって思っちゃって」=“I just couldn't help myself. I was worried whether it was gonna hatch safely.”
「それは少し同意できるわ。でも、その雛も可哀想。あなたが親代わりになるんだから……」=“I can relate to that a bit. But I do feel pretty darn bad for that chick. To think it'd have you for a mommy bird...”
「さすがに刷り込みはしてないよ？　少しだけ誘惑に駆られちゃったけどさ」=“It's not imprinted on me, okay? I didn't go that far. Can't say I didn't feel tempted at all though.”
「ずっと水をあげてたら、ようやくアサガオが咲いたんだよ」=“I've been watering this morning glory for ages, and it finally bloomed a flower.”
「ご苦労さま。あなたって結構マメな性格なのね？」=“Good job. You're a real big kid inside, aren't you?”
「いや、花が咲いたら華やかだろうなって思ってただけなんだけどね」=“No, I just thought that it'd bloom into a pretty beautiful flower once it matured, that's all.”
「また花が咲いたら、見に行ってみてよ」=“Let's go look at it once another flower's about to sprout.”
「そうね。気が向いたら行ってみるわ」=“I suppose. I'll come if I feel like it.”
「アサガオ自体にはさほど興味は無いんだけれど……」=“I don't really care about the flower itself but...”
「あなたの努力の成果には、ちょっとだけ興味があるから」=“I wouldn't mind seeing the fruits of your efforts.”
「マンタってちょっと変わってるよね」=“Mantas are pretty weird, aren't they?”
「あの平べったい体型はなかなか愛嬌があるわね」=“That flat shape does have some charm to it, doesn't it?”
「もし水上に跳び上がりでもしたら、そのまま飛んで行くんじゃないかしら？」=“If they were to leap out of the water, don't you think they'd be able to just fly away?”
「ああいう飛行機とかありそうかも！」=“I feel like that sort of a design would make for a good airplane, yeah!”
「まあ、体重がものすごく重いから飛べないとは思うけど……」=“Then again, they're darn heavy so they probably won't actually fly though...”
「いや、自力で２メートルくらい跳ね上がれるらしいよ」=“No, apparently they can jump as far as 2 meters up into the air on their own.”
「集団で跳んでる映像とか調べればあったはず……すごいよね」=“I bet there's footage of that too, of them doing it in a group... it's amazing, isn't it?”
「実はさ、海ほたるを見ることが出来たんだ」=“I actually got to see some sea fireflies the other day.”
「海上を輝きながら漂う光景は幻想的だよね」=“The sight of them glittering through the sea while just floating around is pretty mystical, isn't it?”
「でも、実態をマジマジとみたらグロテスクよね……」=“But, they're actually pretty grotesque when you look at them up close, you know?...”
「あれって雑食性で何でも食べるらしいし」=“Apparently they're omnivorous so they can eat just about anything too.”
「うっ……そんなロマンのないことを言わなくたって……」=“Uu--... you don't need to ruin the magic of it, you know...”
「私は正しい知識を教えただけよ」=“I just told you the truth and nothing but the truth.”
「この前、ウミガメを見かけたんだ」=“The other day, I came across a sea turtle.”
「この島はけっこう観光客が多いと思うけど、それでも来るものなのね」=“This island's pretty darn full of tourists, yet that doesn't make them stop coming to land, huh?”
「やっぱり、ウミガメって産卵のときは涙を流すのかしら」=“I suppose they really must shed tears when they lay eggs then?”
「さすがに産卵は見られなかったな」=“I wasn't lucky enough to get to see one lay eggs.”
「そうなの？　産卵以外では陸上にあがらないんじゃなかった？」=“Really? Don't they only come up to land when it's time to lay eggs though?”
「じゃあ、タイミングが悪かったのかな……」=“Then, I guess my timing really was bad...”
「砂浜の砂って、本当に星の形をしてるんだね」=“Starsand really does look like stars, doesn't it?”
「南の島の名物よね。でも、砂浜でも取れるのに売店で売ってるなんて……」=“You mean the local product, don't you? But, I can't believe they sell it in shops when you can just take it from the beach...”
「自分で採取すればただで手に入るってことよね？」=“I mean, you can get it for free from the beach, no?”
「たしか、採取が禁止されてたと思うよ。許可がないとダメだって」=“That's banned, from what I remember. You can't harvest it if you don't have permission.”
「サンゴは聞いたことあったけど、星の砂については知らなかったわ。意外と博識なのね」=“I've heard that before about corals but, I didn't know that applied to starsand too. You know a lot.”
「ウムイの鐘って、どうしてカップルが結ばれるって言われてるんだろ？」=“I wonder why it's said that the Bell of Umuy can tie together couples?”
「見た目と、男女が２人で鳴らすからじゃないかしら？」=“From the surface, it's probably because it's usually a male-female couple ringing it, no?”
「ウェディングベルってあるでしょ？　それにあやかったんじゃないかって思うわ」=“I mean, there's wedding bells, no? I feel like it takes inspiration from that.”
「なるほど……そういう考え方もあるのか」=“I see... I guess that train of thought works too.”
「実際はどうなのかはわからないけど、調べてみても面白いかもしれないわね」=“I don't know what it could actually be, the real answer might be pretty interesting.”
「そうだね。観光ガイドとかに載ってるかもしれないし、確認してみるよ」=“Yeah. The guidebook might have it, I'll check it later.”
「おっぱいって、男のロマンがたくさん詰まってると思うんだ……」=“I think boobs have the dreams of men packed within them...”
「……いきなり何を言ってるの、あなた？」=“...What're you even saying so randomly?”
「そんなにおっぱいが好きなら、自分の胸でも触っていればいいじゃない」=“If you love boobs so much, just touch your own, they're the same things.”
「違うんだ！　自分のじゃ……ロマンを感じないんだよ……！」=“They're not! I can't... feel the dreams through my own chest...!”
「訳が分からないわ……。変態なの？」=“I really don't get you... Are you a pervert?”
「うっ……ごめん。ちょっと興奮しすぎたよ……」=“Uuu--... Sorry. I got a bit too horny there...”
「特殊なエッチって、すごく興奮すると思わない？」=“Don't you think unique and special sex is really arousing?”
「ずいぶんと唐突ね……。その内容自体は否定はしないけど」=“That's very random... not that I'm going to deny that.”
「あなたを弄って遊ぶのは面白そうだし……？」=“I mean, the idea of playing with your body sounds pretty fun...?”
「とかいって、本当は自分が弄られる方が好きとか……」=“You say that but, I bet you love it more when I play with yours...”
「そ、そんなわけないじゃない。本当にあなたは変態ねっ」=“N-No way, not at all. You seriously are a pervert--”
「ひ、ひどい。でも、否定できないのが悔しい……」=“S-So mean. But what's worse is I can't deny it...”
「ちょっと聞いてみたいんだけど、欲求不満のときってどうしてるの？」=“I'm just asking this for curiosity's sake but, what do you do when you feel horny?”
「……いきなり何を聞いてくるのよ、あなたは」=“...What're you even asking so suddenly?”
「でも、そうね。強いて言えば……自分で解消したりするかしら」=“But, let's see. If I had to say it... I suppose I take care of it myself.”
「自分で！？　そ、そうなんだ……」=“Yourself?! I-I see...”
「ふふっ、何を想像したの？　私は運動でもして解消するって言ったつもりなんだけど？」=“Fufuh--, what did you just imagine? I mean, I take care of it by doing exercise though. Did I ever say anything else?”
「あっ……う、運動だね。はは、もちろんわかってたとも！　はははは」=“Ah---... e-exercise, huh? Hahah, of course, I knew that! Hahahahah.”
「初めてエッチした時さ……大丈夫だった？　痛くなかったかな？」=“The first time we did it... were you alright? Did it hurt at all?”
「ええ、大丈夫……なわけが無いじゃない。血が出たのに」=“Yes, I was... is that what you expected me to say? I even bled, you saw it.”
「もう……デリカシーがないわね。見たらわかるでしょう」=“Jeez... you seriously are so insensitive. You need to learn to use your eyes.”
「うっ、ごめん……」=“Uu--, sorry...”
「でも、気遣ってくれたのはお礼を言うわ。その……あ、ありが……」=“But, it does make me happy that you worry. So uhm... t-than...”
「やっぱ、何でもない！　ふんっ、ヘタクソ」=“Nevermind, it's nothing afterall! Hmph--, you suck.”
「ぐはっ、そ、そんなひねくれたこと言わなくたって良いじゃないか」=“Gah--, d-do you really have to be so crabby?”
「ヘタクソは、地味にダメージがデカいよ……」=“Especially "you suck", you know that hits harder than anything else...”
