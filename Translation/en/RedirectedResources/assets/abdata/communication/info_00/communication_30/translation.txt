「えっ？　ここ女子トイレよ？　はい、すぐに出ていこうね」=“Eh? This is the women's toilet, you know? Yes, let's leave quickly.”
「……こんな場所にキミがいちゃダメでしょ！？　もしかしてどこかと間違えた？」=“...You know you shouldn't be here, right!? Did you confuse this place with somewhere else?”
「あー、今時間がないの。ごめん、タイミング悪かったね」=“Ah, I don't have time right now. Sorry, you just caught me at a bad time.”
「すぅ……すぅ……んん……今日も頑張る……」=“Haah... Haah... Mmm... I'll work hard today as well...”
「こらっ！　こんな格好は見ちゃいけません！」=“Hey! You shouldn't go around looking like that!”
「水着姿、結構自信あるんだけど……あはは、やっぱり恥ずかしいね」=“I'm pretty confident how I look in my swimsuit, but... Ahaha, it's still pretty embarrassing after all.”
「付いていくのは構わないけど、どこまで行くのかな？」=“I don't mind following you, but where are we going, exactly?”
「ちょっ、どこに入ろうとしてるの！　ダメよっ！」=“Hey, where are you trying to go?! Not there!”
「あっ……ふふっ、キミと話せると思うと何だか楽しくなっちゃうな」=“Ah... Fufu... Just thinking about having a chat with you makes me happy.”
「そういえば……キミって男の子なのよね……あ、ううん、深い意味はないわよ」=“Come to think of it... You really are a boy... Ah, no, I didn't mean anything by that.”
「ひゃんっ！　キミいたの！？　もー、びっくりするじゃない」=“Hyan! You were there!? Geez, you startled me.”
「あら、どうしたの？」=“Oh, what's wrong?”
「何か用？」=“Need something?”
「ん、私とお話したいの？」=“Nn, you want to chat?”
「気軽に話せるって大事だよね」=“Being able to have a casual chat is really important, isn't it?”
「うんうん、気を使いすぎるのは疲れちゃうしね」=“Yepyep, always walking on eggshells gets tiring after a while too.”
「でーも、親しき中にも礼儀あり、だからね？」=“But~, always mind others' personal space, got it?”
「何だか時々すっごく年上に感じることがあるよ」=“For some reason, from time to time, I feel like I'm much older.”
「あはは、実はすっごくすっごく年上なのかもよ？　なーんて」=“Ahaha, don't you mean really, really old? Just kidding.”
「もー、女性に対して失礼じゃないかなぁ？　ま、別に嫌じゃないけど」=“Geez, isn't that quite a rude thing to say to a girl? Well, it's not like I really mind.”
「うーん……今は何か別の話しましょうか」=“Hmm... Let's talk about something else right now.”
「あー、毎日楽して過ごしたいなぁ……」=“Ah~, I wanna spend everyday relaxing~...”
「気持ちはわかるわよ？　でも、かといって楽過ぎてもつまんないのよねー」=“I do understand how you feel, okay? But, just doing that everyday gets boring, you know~?”
「この前、珍しいモノを見つけて……」=“The other day, I came across something really rare...”
「え、なになに？　早く教えてよー」=“Eh, what what? Tell me~”
「恋愛には積極的に行動する方？」=“You the type to be proactive when it's about love?”
「そうだねぇ、当たって砕けろってよく言うし、そうなるんじゃないかしら？」=“Yeah~, nothing ventured nothing gained, as they say, no?”
「ん－、流石に無謀な行動はしたくはないかなぁ」=“Nn~, yeah but even I don't like being too reckless~”
「どんな恋愛をしてみたい？」=“What sort of a love life do you want?”
「んー、理想があっても思い通りに行かないのが恋、ってイメージがあるからなぁ……」=“Nn~, see, the image I have of love is very "It won't go exactly how you want it" so...”
「どんな……って理想はないかな。勝負は時の運、って言うじゃない？」=“I... don't really have something like that. It's all down to the luck of the draw, no?”
「好きな男性のタイプってどんな感じ？」=“What kind of a guy is your type?”
「即答で優しい人。優しければあとは気にしないかな」=“To put it simply, a kind person. As long as they're kind, I guess I don't really mind anything else.”
「うーん、タイプって言われても……自分に合う人？　かしら？」=“Well, even if you say type... a person that fits me? I guess?”
「こういう話ってちょっと難しいというか、恥ずかしいというか……別の話題にしましょ？」=“Talking about this kind of stuff, it's kinda hard, or rather, it's sort of embarrassing... Can we talk about something else?”
「コイバナかぁ……うーん、女子と恋愛のことを話すって難しいなぁ」=“Love talk, huh... Well, talking with girls about love and stuff is pretty difficult.”
「うんうん、分かるよ。異性だもんね」=“Yeah, yeah, I totally get you. It's with the opposite sex after all.”
「ねぇ、こんな噂話、聞いたことある？」=“Hey, have you ever heard about this rumour before?”
「なになに？　昼ドラ的な展開？」=“What what? We talking something soap opera tier?”
「女の子同士、コイバナ的なものってやっぱり多かったりするの？」=“Do girls really gossip about love between each other a lot?”
「んー、キミが想像してるよりは、かもよ？」=“Nn~, maybe. We might do it more than you'd guess, you know?”
「積極的な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about proactive guys?”
「いいんじゃない？　ぐいぐい引っ張ってくれる人、好きよ」=“Aren't they alright? Guys who can strongly take the lead, I like them.”
「積極性を強引と履き違えてたら……嫌ね」=“One can easily mistake coercion as proactiveness so... I don't like it.”
「慎重な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about careful guys?”
「物事をしっかり考えてくれそうで……安心できるかも」=“They think carefully about everything so... I feel like they're reliable.”
「ダメダメ、男の子なら時に大胆に！　時にアグレッシブに！　でしょ？」=“No good, no good, I think guys have to be bold and daring at times! Sometimes you have to be aggressive! You get me?”
「勤勉な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about diligent guys?”
「真面目なのは悪いことじゃないわ。尊敬できるわね」=“It's not a bad thing to be serious and earnest. In my opinion, they're respectable.”
「私がいい加減だからなぁ。あんまり堅苦しいのはちょっと……」=“I'm a bit irresponsible, as you know. Those kinds of people are a bit too stiff for me...”
「マイペースな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of guys who always move at their own pace?”
「周りに流されないのは素敵かも。自分がある！　って感じがするでしょ？」=“The idea of not being caught in the flow of others is wonderful, I think. I have myself! Doesn't it sort of feel like that?”
「独りよがりな感じがして苦手ね。空気が読める人の方がいいわ」=“I'm not good with those sorts of people, they're all a bit caught up with themselves. I'd rather prefer guys who can read the mood.”
「優しい男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about kind and gentle guys?”
「すごくいいわね。優しさって、私にとっては最高のアピールポイントなんだけど……みんなは違うのかしら？」=“They're really nice. Kindness is one of the biggest appeal points for me, but... is that not the case for everyone?”
「優しいだけじゃ物足りないかな。たまには厳しくして欲しいものね」=“Kindness alone isn't enough, in my opinion. I hope that they can be strict at the right times.”
「クールな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about cool guys?”
「冷静沈着、いいわね。そういう人には憧れるわ」=“Being cool, calm and collected sounds great. I really admire those kinds of people.”
「何だか一人で生きていけそうなイメージ。恋愛対象としては難しいかも」=“They feel like the types that prefer living alone, to me. I think it would be hard for me to think of them as potential love interests.”
「この年頃ってみんなエッチなことに興味あるのかな？」=“I wonder if everyone at this age is interested in stuff like sex.”
「おー、さすが男の子。キミはそういうことに興味があるんだね？　ん？　ん？」=“Ah, as expected of a guy. So you have an interest in those sorts of things? Hm? Hm?”
「ここだけの話、私は無きにしも非ずだけど……みんなはどうかしらね」=“Just between you and me, I do have a certain amount of interest but... I wonder about everyone else myself.”
「エッチの時ってやっぱり男がリードするべきなのかな？」=“I wonder if guys should take the lead after all, when it comes to sex?”
「そうねぇ、やっぱりそれが普通なんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで私の意見よ？」=“Right, isn't that the norm after all? A-although, that's just my opinion, you know?”
「女子でもぐいぐい行く娘はいるんじゃない？　好みの問題は別として」=“Aren't there girls that get into the mood quite a bit? Aside from their matter of taste.”
「エッチな本とか読んだことある？」=“Have you read any porn magazines or the like?”
「まぁ、多少はね……あ、でもソフトな方だと思うわよ？」=“Well, a bit... ah but, it's mostly just minor things, okay?”
「興味ないわけじゃないけど、あんまり機会がないかなぁ。でもキミ、女子にそんなこと聞いちゃうわけ？」=“It's not that I'm not interested, but I haven't gotten a chance. But, why are you asking girls that sorts of questions anyway?”
「こういうのってもっと仲良くなってから話すこと……よね？」=“This kind of thing, shouldn't we get to know each other better first... right?”
「この間観た洋画がさ、すごいベッドシーンで……」=“The other day I saw this western movie, and it had this amazing bed scene...”
「え、それ何て洋画？　私も観てみようかしら……なんちゃって」=“Eh, what movie was it? Maybe I'll try watching it... Just kidding.”
「エッチの時って……どうして女の子は声が出ちゃうのかな」=“When having sex... why do girls let out squeals like that?”
「いや、もうそれ完全にセクハラ発言だし……知ってても答えないわよ？」=“Hey, that's straight up sexual harrassment... I wouldn't tell you even if I knew.”
「誰しも、敏感になるところはあるよね……」=“Everyone's got their weak points, don't they...”
「あー、そんな事言って私の弱点聞き出そうって思ってるんでしょー？」=“Ah~, you're trying to get me to fess up about my own, aren't you~?”
「うーん……私の顔、どこか変なところでもある？」=“Well... Is there something weird on my face?”
「もー、気になっちゃうでしょ。あんまりジロジロ見ちゃダメよ？」=“Geez, what is it? Don't stare at my face so much.”
「ダメだってば。さすがに怒るわよ？」=“I said no. I'll get mad for real.”
「……んー、どこ見てるのかな？　ん？　ん？」=“...Hmmm, I wonder where you're looking at? Hm? Hm?”
「そういうとこ、じーっと見るの良くないと思うなぁ。本気よ？」=“I don't think it's good for you to stare there so intently. I'm being serious.”
「キミがセクハラ男子になるのを見過ごすわけにはいかないわね。はい、もう禁止！」=“I can't overlook this sexual harrassment anymore. Here, that's enough!”
「……ジロジロ見たって何も変わらないよ」=“...Staring at it so intently won't actually make it change or anything, you know.”
「えっ……いきなりどうしたの？　私の手、何か気になる？」=“Eh... What's this all of a sudden? Why the sudden interest in my hand?”
「やんっ……もー、男子に手を握られるのって結構緊張するのよ？」=“Yah... Geez, it's nervewracking to have your hand suddenly grasped by a guy, you know?”
「そんなに触っちゃダメ。あんまりやりすぎると気持ち悪いって思っちゃうわよ？」=“Don't touch there so much. If you overdo it, I'll feel disgusted, you know?”
「ひゃんっ！　う、うそっ……わざとじゃない……わよね？」=“Hyan! N-no way... That wasn't on purpose... was it?”
「わざと触ってるの！？　こ、こんなことしちゃダメ……って、教えてあげなきゃ分からない？」=“Was that on purpose!? Y-you can't do things like that... Wait, why do I even have to explain it to you?”
「もう、分かっててやってるなら質が悪いよ？　いい？　こういうことはいけないことなの！」=“Geez, doing it when you know makes you even worse, you know? Got it? You can't go around doing things like this!”
「あら……頭、何かついてた？」=“Oh... Was there something on my head?”
「もう……誰にでも簡単にそういうことしちゃダメ。意外と特別なことなのよ？」=“Geez... You can't go around doing stuff like that to everyone so easily. It's actually a very special thing to do, you know?”
「お互いに誤解されたら困るでしょ？　だからここまで！　ね？」=“A misunderstanding about something like this will trouble us both, no? So, stop there! Alright?”
「こ、こらっ、いきなりなんてことするのっ！？」=“H-hey, what do you think you're doing all of a sudden!?”
「人のほっぺた触って喜ぶなんて悪趣味すぎるわよ、もう」=“Being that happy while touching someone's cheek is in bad taste, geez.”
「うーん、さすがの私もイライラしちゃいそうな空気……本気よ？」=“Um, even someone like me will get irritated if you keep this up... I'm being serious.”
「……何を考えてるの？」=“...What are you thinking?”
「ちょっとずつキミとの距離が縮まってる気がするわね。私の勘違い……じゃないといいんだけど♪」=“I feel like the distance between us is slowly decreasing. I hope that... I'm not the only one who feels this way ♪”
「男子との会話って新鮮ね」=“Having a conversation like this with a guy feels so refreshing.”
「うーん、何か楽しい話はないかしら……」=“Well, I wonder if there's anything fun to talk about...”
「キミって……聞きたい言葉も言ってくれずに放っておくのね」=“You're just... going to leave without saying the words I want to hear, huh.”
「……ごめんなさい、もうやめましょう。なんだかイメージと違う会話になっちゃったわね」=“...I'm sorry, let's stop here. Somehow this conversation turned out different from what I was expecting.”
「こういう状態で会話しても楽しくないわよね」=“It's not fun to have a chat in a situation like this.”
「キミと話してるとすごく楽しいわ。また色々話しましょ」=“It's really fun talking with you. Let's talk about tons of different things soon.”
「キミの話聞いてると……私、興味津々になっちゃう。何にって……それは秘密よ♪」=“Whenever you tell me something new... I always become super interested in it. Which parts...? That's a secret ♪”
「今回はここまでにしましょ。またね」=“Let's stop here for now. See you later.”
「っと、そろそろ行かなくちゃいけないの。またお話しましょ？」=“Oh, I really gotta dash now. Let's chat again later?”
「続きはまた今度。それじゃまたね」=“We'll continue this later. Wait for me until then.”
「ええ、それじゃこれで。キミさえ良ければ、また声かけてね」=“Yes, then let's stop here for now. If it's good with you, call me out for another chat, okay?”
「ふふっ、またね」=“Fufu, see you.”
「ちょっと観光しに行かない？」=“Wanna go sightseeing together a bit?”
「そうね、私も行ってみようかしら」=“Sure, I guess I'll join you.”
「あーごめんなさい、また今度さそってもらえるかしら？」=“Ah, I'm sorry, could you ask me another time?”
「よかったら、これから遊ばない？」=“If you'd like, wanna go have some fun?”
「面白そうね、私も付いていくわ」=“Sounds interesting, count me in.”
「うーん……ごめんね、遠慮しておくわ」=“Nnn~... I'm sorry, I'll pass.”
「ねぇ、一緒に体験コーナーに行ってみない？」=“Hey, wanna go hit up the experience corner together?”
「えぇ、いいわよ」=“Yes, sure.”
「ごめんなさい、ちょっと都合が悪いの……」=“I'm sorry, I'm kind of busy...”
「どこか食べに行こうと思うんだけど、一緒にどうかな？」=“I was thinking of going and grabbing a bite to eat somewhere, how about joining me?”
「そうね、お腹も空いてきたし、行ってみようかしら」=“Yeah, I do feel pretty hungry, so maybe I just might.”
「残念、あんまりお腹空いてないのよねー」=“Sorry, I'm not really hungry, you know~?”
「ちょっと付いてきてもらっていい？」=“Can you come with me for a second?”
「ふふっ、どうしたの？」=“Fufu, what's up?”
「ごめん、今は無理なの。ちょっとタイミング悪かったかな」=“Sorry, I can't right now. Your timing is a bit bad.”
「ちょ、ちょっとなに普通に入ってきてるの？　誰かに見つかったら大問題よ？」=“J-just what are you doing, entering this place so casually? If someone finds you, that'll be a big problem, you know?”
「きゃーっ！　ここは女子トイレ！　キミは使っちゃダメよ！」=“Kyah! This is the girls' toilet! You can't use it!”
「も、もー、私しかいなかったからいいものの……キミ、変なところで度胸あるのね」=“G-geez, it's fine since there wasn't anyone but me who would be okay with this... You sure have tons for courage for the weirdest things...”
「きゃっ！　こんなとこで何してるの！？　って、くつろいでないで早く出なきゃダメよ！」=“Kyaa! What are you doing in this place!? Hey, stop this isn't your place so hurry up and leave already!”
「あっ、ごめんね、今はちょっと忙しくて……また今度、ね？」=“Ah, sorry, I'm a bit busy right now... Maybe next time, okay?”
「ひゃあぁっ！　こんな姿見られたっ！　お嫁に行けなくなったら、キミが責任取ってくれるの？　なんちゃって」=“Hyaaa! To be seen like this! If I can't become a bride anymore, will you take responsibility? Just kidding.”
「こ、こらっ！　いくら興味があってもそんなにジロジロ見ちゃダメよ！」=“H-Hey! No matter how interested you might be, you can't just stare like that!”
「別に見られるのは嫌じゃないけど……やっぱり恥ずかしいわよね」=“While I don't particularly hate being seen like this... It's still embarrassing after all.”
「こういう姿を堂々と見るのもスゴイと思うなぁ、お姉さんは」=“Onee-san doesn't know whether to be shocked or amazed at how brazenly you're just staring at her...”
「きちんと付いてきてるわよ」=“I'm right behind you.”
「ちょっと、ちょっと！　どこに入ろうとしてるのっ」=“Wait, wait! Where do you think you're going?”
「時々ね、キミのことすごいなぁって思うよ。尊敬しちゃう」=“Sometimes, I can't help but think how amazing you are. I really respect you.”
「うーん、キミを見てると男女の身体の違いが気になってきちゃうなぁ。あ、え、エッチな話じゃないよ？」=“Well, when I look at you, I can't help but notice how different a man's body is compared to ours. Ah, I-I wasn't talking about anything lewd, okay?”
「きゃんっ！　キミっ、いたの！？　へ、変な声聞かないでよ、もー」=“Kyaa! You were there!? I-I ended up letting out such a weird noise, geez.”
「なになに？　お姉さんに用かな？」=“What is it? You need something from this onee-san?”
「どうしたの？　私とお話したくなっちゃった？」=“What's wrong? Felt like talking to me?”
「あら、丁度キミの声が聴きたかったの……なーんて」=“Oh my, I just wanted to hear your voice, you know... just kidding~”
「時々、お姉ちゃんっぽいって言われない？」=“Do people often tell you that you're like an onee-chan?”
「うんうん、よく言われるわよ。キミもそう感じるなら、これからは私のこと、お姉ちゃんだと思ってみる？」=“Yep, I get told that very often. If you feel the same way, you can think of me as your onee-chan as well, you know?”
「自分ではそう思われたいんだけど……意外と年下扱いされちゃったりするのよね……」=“I feel the same way about myself but... sometimes it's surprising when I'm treated like I'm younger than I am...”
「人間、やっぱり素直が一番だよね」=“Being honest really is the best, isn't it?”
「うんうん、身も心も素直が一番よ」=“Yepyep, you should be honest with both your body and your heart.”
「ふふっ、どうかしら？　私もいろんな事を秘めてるかもしれないわよ……？」=“Fufuh--, who knows? I could be hiding a whole lot, you know...?”
「こういう場所に来ると、やっぱりテンション上がるよね」=“Coming to a place like this really has a way of filling you with energy, isn't it?”
「そうね、ついついはしゃいじゃうわね」=“Yeah, I just can't help running around sometimes.”
「でも、あまり羽目を外し過ぎるのはダメよ？」=“But, don't use that as an excuse to go too crazy, okay?”
「この島は、陸・海両方とも魅力的なところが多いよね=On this island, both the sea and the land have a lot of charming things on offer, don't they?
「そうね、こんな綺麗な海を実際に見るのは初めてだったわ」=“Yeah, it's the first time I've ever seen a sea this pretty before.”
「えぇ、豊かな自然で彩られている、とてもいい島だと思うわ」=“Yes, I think it's a really nice place, the way it's so surrounded by so much vivid green.”
「うーん、せっかくだからキミとは違うお話がしたいわね」=“Well, we don't get to talk often so I want to talk about something else with you.”
「そういえばこの前ふと見つけたんだけど……」=“Reminds me, the other day I just happened to come across...”
「あぁ、それ私も見たことあるわ、何だったのかしらね……？」=“Aah, I've seen that before too, I wonder what it really was...?”
「やっぱり彼氏とか欲しい？」=“So you want a boyfriend after all?”
「まぁ、そういうお年頃だしね。なに？　キミが立候補してくれたりするの？」=“Well, I am at that age. Why? Are you going to announce your candidacy for it?”
「うーん、はっきりイエスと答える自信はないわね。今は勉強も大変だし……」=“Well, I don't have the confidence to reply with a solid yes. Not to mention we're really busy with our studies as it is...”
「将来の夢とかってある？」=“Got any dreams for the future?”
「それはもちろん、いいお嫁さんになることよ？」=“Of course, I want to become a good wife to someone someday, you know?”
「んー、将来的な事よりも今目の前の事の方が大事、かな……？」=“Nn~, for me, I'd say what's in front of me right now's more important...?”
「周りから恋愛事を相談されたとき、どう対処する？」=“How do you deal with it, when people ask you for love advice?”
「そうね、私だったら思いっきり応援してあげたくなるわね」=“Well, I for one just can't help but want to cheer them on hard, you know?”
「んー、あくまでその人の問題だからね、私はそっと背中を押す程度に留めておくわ」=“Nn~, I mean, at the end of the day, it's their fight to fight, not mine, so I just push their back really.”
「恋愛系の番組とかって見たりする？」=“Do you watch romantic TV shows and whatnot?”
「ふふっ、ちょっとだけ参考にしてるのは内緒よ？」=“Fufuh--, I do a bit for research's sake but that's between you and me, okay?”
「あまり見ないかしら？　自分の気持ちが染まってしまいそうで怖いもの」=“Not really, I'd say? I'm scared they'd influence how I feel personally.”
「待って待って。こういう話はまた別の機会にしましょ」=“Wait, Wait. Let's talk about stuff like this another time.”
「彼女と喧嘩したって愚痴を友達から聞かされてさ……」=“A friend of mine was talking my ear off the other day about how he had a spat with his girlfriend...”
「あはは……きっと喧嘩するほど仲が良い、って奴だよ」=“Ahaha... They must be really close, to be able to quarrel like that.”
「日頃からエッチなこととか考える？」=“Have you been thinking about doing lewd things on a daily basis?”
「素直に言えばそうだけど……その質問をしたキミがすごいって思うわ」=“Being honest, that is the case, but... I can't help but be amazed that you have what to be able to ask that...”
「考えません！　……本当。本当よ！？」=“I do not at all! ...Really. I'm telling you the truth!”
「エッチってさ、男女でするだけじゃないって知ってる？」=“About sex, did you know that it's not only between a man and a woman?”
「え？　同性とってこと？　……まあ、知ってるわよ」=“Eh? You mean people of the same sex doing it? ...Well, I know of it.”
「し、知らない知らない。一人でもするなんて知らないんだから！」=“I-I didn't know, I didn't know. I also don't know that you can do it by yourself, just so you know!”
「憧れのエッチとかある？」=“Is there any particular type of sex you long for?”
「ふふっ、あるわよ。昔観た映画でね、車の中で激しく……って、素敵だなって思っただけよ？」=“Fufu, there is. I saw it in a movie a long time ago, where they were doing it rough in a car... Er, I just thought it was pretty nice, that's all.”
「特にないわね……そういうシーンを観ても自分に置きかえて考えられないもの」=“Nothing in particular... Even if I saw such a scene in a movie, I don't think I could imagine myself in the same position.”
「エッチな夢とか見ちゃう？」=“Do you get wet dreams?”
「うぅ……たまにあるのよね……顔は分からないんだけど、すごく好きな人に抱き締められる幸せな夢」=“Uuu... Sometimes I do... Although I can't tell who it is from the face, it's always a good dream about me being hugged by the person I love the most.”
「多分ないと思うわ。起きたら忘れてるんですもの」=“Don't think I do. I always forget my dreams when I wake up anyway.”
「こんな話……いくらキミでもオープンすぎるわ。だからＮＧです」=“This kind of talk... Even if it's you, this is too personal, so it's no go for me.”
「耳年増な女の子って、どこで知識を得てくるんだろう」=“All those girls who consider themselves experts in sex, I wonder where they get all their information.”
「えっと……やっぱりネットじゃない？　いや、私は耳年増じゃないけどね？」=“Um... Probably the internet? No, I'm not saying that I'm like those girls though, okay?”
「そんなに見つめてどうしたの？　何か気になる？」=“You keep staring at me so much, what's up? You worried about something?”
「うーん、男の子の考えることって難しいわね……なにかしら……」=“Well, the things that go through a guy's head are hard to understand... I wonder what...”
「も、もー、分かったわ、私の負け！　恥ずかしいからもう見ないで？　ね？」=“G-geez, I get it, it's my loss! It's embarrassing so would you stop staring at me? Alright?”
「あ……キミ今……ふふっ、何でもない。それとも言ってあげた方がキミのためかしら？」=“Ah... Just now, you... Fufu, it's nothing. Or would it be better if I said it out loud, for your sake?”
「だから気付いてるってば。そういうところは見ちゃダメよ、もう」=“That's why I'm conscious of it! Don't stare at that place so much, geez.”
「キミ、わざとジロジロ見てるでしょう。いい加減にしないと、お姉さん怒っちゃうんだからね」=“You're staring at it so intently on purpose, aren't you? If you don't cut it out, onee-san will get mad, you know?”
「ジロジロ観察する前にやることがあるんじゃないかしら？」=“Isn't there something you should do before staring at me like that?”
「きゃっ……ど、どうしたの？　何か付いてた？」=“Kyaa... W-what's wrong? Did something happen?”
「あんまり気軽に触らないの。女子はデリケートなのよ？」=“Don't go around touching people so casually. Girls are very delicate, you know?”
「もー、ダメって言ってるでしょう。手を触られるだけで色々考えちゃうんだから！」=“Geez, I'm telling you can't. Just having my hand touched like that makes me thing of all kinds of stuff!”
「ひゃんっ！　え……な、なに、今何したの？　わざと……じゃないわよね？」=“Hyan! Eh... W-what did you just do? That was... on purpose, right?”
「ひゃぁっ！　わざと触ったの！？　あ、有り得ないと思うんだけど……」=“Hyan! Was that on purpose!? I-I thought that you wouldn't ever but...”
「はぅっ、さすがにもう触らせないわよ。セクハラなんだからね」=“Hauu, I won't let you touch me anymore. This is clearly sexual harassment.”
「あら……何かしら？　突然なでなでしたくなったの？」=“Oh... What is it? Did you have a sudden craving to pat someone's head?”
「むぅ……何だか小さな子みたいな扱い……私のキャラに合わないなぁ」=“Muu... Treating me like a little kid... I don't think it fits my character.”
「恥ずかしいからここまで！　さすがに照れちゃうわ」=“This is embarrassing so that's it! Any more and I'll become really shy and bashful.”
「ひゃんっ……むぅ、今、柔らかいとか思ったでしょう？」=“Hyan... Muu, just now, you were thinking that I was really soft, weren't you?”
「柔らかさを確認しなくていいの！　そんなに強く触ったら跡ついちゃう！」=“You don't have to confirm that it's soft! If you feel it up with so much strength, it'll leave marks!”
「こーらー、お姉さんをバカにしてると怖い目に遭わせちゃうわよー！」=“Look here, if you keep making fun of this onee-san, you'll find yourself having an encounter with a pair of scary eyes-!”
「キミはもっと空気を読むべきだと思うわ」=“I think you ought to learn how to read the mood a bit more.”
「キミと話してると何でも新鮮。わくわくしちゃうなぁ」=“If I'm talking with you, any old topic seems fresh. It makes me really excited.”
「男の子との会話って楽しいのね。ふふっ」=“Talking with a guy sure is fun, fufu.”
「誰かとおしゃべりするのってストレス解消にもなるのよ。キミも楽しんでくれてるかしら？」=“Chatting with someone sure works wonders for stress relief. Are you also having fun?”
「あら、難しい顔してどうしたのかしら？　何か楽しいお話を考えてくれてるの？」=“Oh, did something happen for you to make that serious face? Are you thinking of fun conversations to have?”
「こういう時に黙っちゃうなんて……はぁぁ」=“At times like these I should just be silent... Haah.”
「今の私、ちょっとイライラしちゃってる。何でだか……分かるわよね？」=“Right now, I'm a bit frustrated. You do you know why... right?”
「もう……全然すっきりしない。じゃあね」=“Geez... I can't seem to calm down. See you later.”
「今度またキミとお話出来るのが楽しみよ。色々なこと、聞かせてね」=“I'm looking forward to talking with you again. Let's talk about lots of things, alright?”
「健全なお話も楽しいけど……次回はもう少しドキドキするお話でも……なーんて。ふふっ、それじゃまたね」=“It is fun having wholesome conversations like this but... let's talk about more heart-throbbing things next time... just kidding. Fufu, I'll see you later.”
「楽しい時間をありがとう。またお話しましょうね」=“Thank you for such a fun time. Let's talk again sometime.”
「それじゃ、またキミの声、聞かせて頂戴ね？」=“Well then, let me hear your voice again soon, okay?”
「あ、もう行かなきゃいけないの……残念だわ」=“Ah, I really gotta go now... what a shame.”
「ええ、またいつでも声を掛けて。楽しみに待ってるわね」=“Yes, call for me again at any time. I'll be looking forward to it.”
「ええ、またね」=“Yes, see you later.”
「俺、[H名]の事が好きなんだ」=“I am in love with you, [H名].”
「んー、困ったわね……ごめんなさい、返事はちょっと待ってくれるかしら？」=“Nn~, oh boy... I'm sorry, do you mind waiting just a bit for my answer?”
「ねぇ、キミの事、好きって言ったら信じてくれる……？」=“Hey, if I said I love you, would you believe me...?”
「あら、本気にしちゃったかしら？　冗談よ、冗談……」=“Oh my, did you take it seriously? It was a joke, just a joke...”
「あ、あのさ、[H名]とHしたいなって」=“I-I was thinking, I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「え？　冗談でしょ？　うそ、本気……なの？　ごめんなさい、さすがにそれは抵抗あるわね……」=“Eh? You're joking, right? No way, are you... serious? I'm sorry, I'll have to say no...”
「[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「もう……キミ、押せば何とかなるって思ってるでしょう？　まぁ、実際負けちゃうんだけど……ふふっ、いいわ、しましょ？」=“Geez... You think I'll eventually say yes if you keep at it for long enough, don't you? Well, I actually do feel like giving in... Fufu, alright, let's do it.”
「そういうのは無理よ。身体だけじゃなくて気持ちの問題もあるし……」=“That's impossible for me. It's not about the physical aspect, but it has to do with feelings...”
「ここで[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you here, [H名].”
「人……いるわよ？　本気？　だったら……付き合うけど♪　そういうプレイ……私も興味あるもの」=“There are... people here though? Really? In that case... I'll go along with you ♪ This kind of fetish play... I've also been interested in it.”
「エッチっていうのは、人がいないところでするものよ？　秘め事っていうでしょう？」=“Isn't sex something you do in a place devoid of people? It's like a secret, right?”
「うそ、こんなところで？　でも……ふふっ、たまにはそういうスリルもいいかもね」=“No way, in a place like this? But... Fufu, sometimes fetish play like this is also fine I suppose.”
「ここでなんてダメよ。もう、勢い任せなんだから」=“A place like this is no good. Geez, I'll leave it to you then.”
「あ、あのねっ……実は私、すっごくエッチに興味があるの！　だから……その……して……くれないかな？」=“Y-you know... In all honesty, I'm actually really interested in sex! So that's why... that is... won't you... do it with me?”
「ありがとう。変な娘だって思われるかもしれないけど……こんなこと、キミにしか頼めなくて……」=“Thank you. I don't know if you think of me as a strange girl because of it but... something like this, there's no one I could ask except you...”
「わわっ、そ、そうよね！　ごめんなさい。私、ちょっとどうかしてたみたい……お願い、忘れて？」=“Wah, y-you're right! I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me... Please, can you just forget about it?”
「二人で島を観光しない？」=“Wanna go sightsee a bit together?”
「ええ、キミとならいいわよ？」=“Yes, I don't mind if it's with you, you know?”
「ねぇ、私と一緒に島を歩かない？」=“Hey, could you make some time and come sightsee a bit with me?”
「ふふっ、よかった。　それじゃ早速行きましょ？」=“Fufuh--, great. Let's go right away then?”
「そう……じゃ、また今度誘うわね」=“I see... I'll ask again then, okay?”
「興味があったら、一緒にカヤックに乗ってみない？」=“If you're up for it, wanna go try riding a kayak together?”
「いいわよ？　行ってみましょ？」=“I don't mind, you know? Let's go?”
「残念だけど、また今度誘ってくれるかしら？」=“Sorry but, could you ask me another time?”
「どうかしら、ちょっと遊んでみない？」=“How about it, want to go have some fun?”
「ＯＫ、行きましょ行きましょ」=“Okay then, let's go let's go.”
「そっか、残念ね……」=“I see, that's a shame...”
「ねぇ、体験コーナーに行ってみない？」=“Hey, wanna go hit up the experience corner together?”
「あら面白そうね、行ってみましょ？」=“That sounds pretty interesting, let's go?”
「あー、ちょっと今は……悪いわね」=“Ah, now's a bit... sorry.”
「ねぇ、キミと一緒にやってみたい体験があるんだけど、今から大丈夫？」=“Hey, there's an experience I want to try doing with you, is now a good time?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。それじゃあ早速行きましょうか」=“Fufuh--, thanks. Let's go right away then, hmm?”
「そう、都合が悪いなら仕方ないわね」=“I see, if you're busy then it's alright.”
「お腹空いてるなら一緒に食事とかどう？」=“If you're hungry, how about we get something to eat?”
「いいわよ、丁度食べたかったのよ」=“Sure, I was just feeling my stomach complain a bit.”
「そうね……もう少しお腹が空いたら行ってみようかしら」=“Hmm... I think I'll head over when I feel a bit more hungry.”
「ちょっとどこかで食べようと思うんだけど、折角ならキミも来ない？」=“I was thinking of getting something to eat somewhere, how you join me? Might as well, right?”
「よし。あーほんとお腹空いたわぁ～……」=“Alright. Ah~, I'm seriously hungry right now~...”
「あら、男の子なんだから沢山食べなきゃダメよ？」=“Oh dear, you're a growing boy, you gotta eat lots, you know?”
「付いてきてもらってもいい？」=“Hey, can you come with me?”
「ええ、どうしたの？」=“Alright, what is it?”
「待って待って。今は無理よ。ちょっと用事があるの」=“Wait, wait. I can't right now. I have something else to do.”
「こんなところに来て何する気？　もう……男の子って本当にエッチなんだから」=“What are you planning to do, bringing me to a place like this? Geez... boys are always only thinking about lewd things.”
「ねぇ、ここが女子トイレだって分かって入ってきたでしょ？　そう言うことしちゃ、めっ、よ？」=“Hey, you entered this place knowing this is the girl's toilet, right? You know that doing something like that is wrong, yes?”
「も、もうっ……こんなところで男子と一緒だなんて……誰かに見られたら絶対怪しまれるでしょ」=“G-geez... Being in a place like this with a boy... If someone saw us, they'll definitely think we're doing something suspicious...”
「キミはこんな場所に興味があるヘンタイさんなのかしら？　ん？」=“Having an interest in a place like this, are you a pervert? Hmm?”
「ごめんね……時間がある時に、またゆっくり話しましょう」=“I'm sorry... Let's catch up properly when I have some free time.”
「こ、こういうの……改めて見られるのって……恥ずかしいのよ？」=“T-this is... being seen like this... It's really embarrassing, you know?”
「こらこら、そんなにジロジロ見ないの。キミ、軽蔑されちゃうわよ？」=“Hey, hey, don't stare at me like that. I'll start hating you at this rate, you know?”
「え、えっと……どうかしら？　なによ、お姉さんだって緊張くらいするんだから」=“U-um... What is it? Don't stare like that, this onee-san gets nervous easily.”
「へぇ、女子の水着……そんなに興味あるんだ。まったく……男の子ってどうしようもないんだから」=“Huh, so a you were that interested... in the girls' swimsuit. Seriously... boys really can't be helped...”
「何かしら？　二人きりじゃないと話せないことなのよね？」=“What is it? It's something we can't talk about unless we're alone, isn't it?”
「こらこら待ちなさい。そんなとこに入ったら冗談じゃすまなくなるわよ？」=“Hey, wait, stop right there. If you enter a place like that, I won't be able to excuse it as just a joke, okay?”
「キミと一緒にいる時の私、自分でも舞い上がっちゃってるなぁって思うわ。恥ずかしい……」=“Whenever I'm with you, I get so excited that I surprise myself. It's so embarrassing...”
「今まで男の子の知り合いって少なかったから……その……色々なとこ、気になっちゃうな」=“I've never been all that close to many male friends until now so... that is... There's lots of things I'm so curious about.”
「ひゃぁんっ！？　あ、キミ……も、もう……ちょっとエッチな声聞かれちゃった♪」=“Hyan!? Ah, it's you... g-geez... you made me let out such a lewd voice ♪”
「ふふっ、今日はどんなお話出来るのかしら？　キミとだったら毎回新鮮よ」=“Fufu, what shall we talk about today? If it's with you, no matter what we talk about, it always seems fresh.”
「会いたいと思ったときに来てくれるなんて、やっぱり運命だったかしら？」=“Always coming to see me whenever I want to see you, it really is fate between us, huh?”
「あら、どうかしたのかしら？　未来の旦那さん？」=“Oh dear, is something wrong, my future husband?”
「疲れた時はどうしてる？」=“What do you do when you feel tired?”
「そうね、やっぱり何もせず横になるのが一番かしら？」=“Let's see, isn't just lying down on bed for some zzzs the best option?”
「私は、幸せだった事を思い出しながら心を落ち着かせるかしらね？」=“For me, I suppose I think back to all the happy times I've had and relax my heart?”
「わりと夜更かしとかする？」=“Do you stay up late often?”
「するする。夜中のテレビって面白くって……お肌には良くないんだけどね……」=“I do, I do. I really like watching late night shows. Although, I hear it's not good for your skin to stay up late...”
「実は私、夜に弱いの。すぐに眠くなっちゃって……あー、お子様だって思ったでしょう？」=“Actually, I'm rather bad at doing that. I always feel super sleepy at night... Ah, you think I'm just like a little kid, don't you?”
「健康には気を使ったりする？」=“Do you pay attention to your health?”
「もちろん。キミと会えなくなるのだけは嫌だからね？」=“Of course. Not being able to see you is the one thing I don't want in my life, you know?”
「そこまで気にしてはないけど、最低限の事は自然としてる気がするわ」=“Not all that much but, I feel like I do atleast the bare minimum subconsciously.”
「記念品とかってあったらほしい？」=“Would you want a memento, if we could have one?”
「そうね、やっぱり思い出に残るような品があるとより鮮明に思い出せる気がするわ」=“Yeah, I can't deny that having one of those would make our memories a whole lot more vivid down the line.”
「あったら嬉しいかもしれないけど、やっぱり大事なのは気持ちだと思うわ」=“I wouldn't say no to one, I'd love it if we had one but, I think feelings are definitely more important than things.”
「あ、そういう話題はちょっと……違うこと話そっか」=“Ah, that topic is a bit... let's talk about something else.”
「これ、ここだけの話なんだけどさ……」=“Just between us...”
「……なるほど、そんな事があったのね」=“...I see, so something like that happened, huh?”
「あのさ、たまには俺も『お姉さん』って呼んでみていい？」=“Hey, do you mind if I call you "onee-san" sometimes too?”
「別に構わないけど……キミ、そういうのが好きなの？」=“I don't particularly mind but... I didn't know you liked that sort of thing.”
「もしかして恋愛に溺れるタイプ？」=“Are you perhaps the type to lose your head over things like love?”
「そ、そうよ。悪い？　ふんだ、どうせキミに出会うまでは気付きませんでしたよーだ。もう……大好きっ♪」=“T-that's right. Is that bad? Hmph, it's not like I cared that much about it before I met you anyway. Geez... I love you ♪”
「お姉さんがそういうタイプに見える？　しっかり自立した女性でしょ？　もう」=“Does this onee-san really look like that type of person to you? Don't you actually mean an independent woman instead? Geez.”
「理想のお嫁さん像ってあったりする？」=“Do you have an ideal life as a wife in your head?”
「それはもう、愛する旦那に最大限に尽くす事が理想的、かしら？」=“Of course, for me it's being able to shoulder my beloved future husband's burden as much as I can, I suppose?”
「そうね、お互いにお互いを支え合う夫婦になりたいわね」=“Yeah, I'd love it if we could become a family that supports each other.”
「好きでい続ける為にはどういう事が有効的かな？」=“I wonder what'd be effective at keeping our love for each other strong?”
「そうね……どんな事でも許す寛大な心が大事かしら？」=“Let's see... a lenient heart that forgives all, I suppose?”
「私だったら、お互いの気持ちをしっかりとぶつけ合う事が大事だと思うわ」=“Personally, I think it's important for us to just keep blasting each other with our love.”
「好きだよ」=“I love you.”
「ふふっ、私も好き、愛してるわ」=“Fufuh--, I love you too, dearly.”
「っ……もぉ、不意打ち過ぎよ」=“--!... Jeez, surprise attacks are unfair, you know.”
「えっと……ちょっと照れちゃった。こういう話はまた今度にしましょう」=“Um... I'm getting a bit embarrassed. Let's talk about this some other time.”
「[H名]が彼女で本当に良かった」=“I'm so glad you're my girlfriend, [H名].”
「え……い、いきなり？　私だってキミが彼氏で良かったって思ってるわよ。ふふっ、本当よ？」=“Eh... W-what's this all of a sudden? I'm glad that you're my boyfriend too. Fufu, I'm serious, you know?”
「やっぱり、甘えられる人がいるのは大事だよね」=“It really is important to have that one person who spoils you, isn't it?”
「あら、甘えたいと思ってるのはキミだけじゃないのよ……？」=“Oh dear, you're not the only one who wants to be spoiled, you know...?”
「特殊な性癖とかってある？」=“Do you have any particularly peculiar fetishes or anything?”
「えっと……敢えて言うならＢＬ……うそ、ごめんなさい、何でもない！　何でもないったらー！」=“Um... If I have to pick, I suppose BL... That's a lie, I'm sorry, it was nothing! I'm saying that it isn't!”
「そんなこと自分じゃ分かんないわよー。みんな自分のことはノーマルだと思ってるものよ？」=“Something like that, I don't think anyone really knows about themselves. Doesn't everyone think themselves as normal?”
「背中って感じるかな？」=“Do you feel any sensations in your back?”
「ぞくぞくはしちゃうけど……それって感じるってことなの？　あ、なにその目、やらしいんだから」=“I do feel a shiver down it but... Is that what you meant by "feel"? Ah, what's with those lewd eyes?”
「触ると痒くならない？　うそ、私だけ？　やーん、ムードなくてごめんなさい」=“Doesn't it feel itchy when touched? No way, is it just me? Ehh, sorry, I'm not in the mood right now.”
「自分はＭだと思う？」=“Do you think you're an M?”
「うーん、女の子って基本はＭの娘が多いんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで一般論よ？」=“Well, don't you think that generally there are a lot of girls who are masochists? T-that's just a regular guess though.”
「ふふっ、私は間違いなくドＳね。キミのこと、いっぱい苛めたいもの……って、本気で答えたらどうする気なの？」=“Fufu, I am unmistakably a hard S. I really want to tease you all day... If I actually replied with that seriously, what would you do?”
「鏡とかでさ、自分のアソコをじっくり見たことある？」=“Hey, have you ever, by using a mirror or whatever, properly taken a look down there?”
「恥ずかしいこと平気で聞くんだから……その、あるわ。だって、気になったんだもの……」=“You really ask the most embarrassing things so easily... Yes, I've done that. I mean, I was curious...”
「じっくりと見たことは……って、なに真面目に答えてるの、私！」=“I have taken a good... Wait, why am I answering this so seriously!?”
「今、恥ずかしい話はちょっと……他のこと話しましょう」=“Talking about such embarrassing things is a bit... Let's talk about something else.”
「エッチって……なんだろうね」=“I wonder... what is sex, really?”
「哲学？　よく分からないけど、キミがにやにやしてることだけは分かるわね」=“An interest in philosophy? I don't really get it myself, but I do know that you're grinning from ear-to-ear.”
「この間、道ばたにエッチな道具が落ちてて……」=“The other day, I saw some sex toys on the side o the road...”
「ど、どんな道具かしら……男性用？　女性用？　あっ、ち、違うのよ。ちょっと気になっただけ」=“W-what kind of toys... For men? For women? Ah, i-it's not like that. I was just a bit curious, that's all.”
「ん？　なになに？　どうしたの？」=“Hmm? What? Something the matter?”
「もう、そうやってお姉さんを困らせないの。恥ずかしいでしょ」=“Jeez, Don't make your onee-san worried like that. It's embarrassing.”
「一体何が目的なのかしら？　お姉さん、深読みしちゃうからダメよ？」=“Just what on earth are you intending? I'll start reading too much into things, so don't do that”
「こら、今絶対エッチなこと考えてたでしょう？　気付かないと思ってるの？」=“Hey, just now, you were definitely thinking about lewd stuff, weren't you? You really think that I'm dense enough to not notice it?”
「男の子ってそんなにおっぱい好きなの？　それともキミが特別？」=“Do boys really love breasts that much? Or is it that you're a unique specimen?”
「やだ、私の彼氏って……もしかしておっぱいと付き合いたい人なのかしら……？」=“No way, my boyfriend... Is he really the type to go out with a walking pair of tits if he could...?”
「ねぇ、私はキミに謝って欲しいの。単純、簡単、明快、でしょ？」=“Hey, I want you to apologize to me. Simple, Quick and Uncomplicated, right?”
「わわっ、もうっ……前置きなしでいきなり……ううん、嫌じゃないよ♪」=“W-Woah, Jeez... No beating around the bush, huh?... No, I don't hate it ♪”
「何度も握られるのはちょっと……恥ずかしいよ？」=“Being grabbed like this again and again is a bit... embarrassing, you know?”
「何回もにぎにぎしないの！　こういうのはほら……そういう雰囲気の時にやることよ？」=“Stop grabbing me like this again and again! Things like this... We should only do it in, uh, that, kind of mood”
「やんっ……こ、こらっ、いくら恋人でもダメでしょ」=“Hyan... H-Hey, Cut it out, even if we're lovers, this kind of thing is no good.”
「うそ……キミ、そういうこと平気で出来ちゃう人なのっ……？」=“No way... Are you someone who lets it out that easily?”
「もう……お姉さん、本気で呆れちゃうわよ？　いいの？　これからそういう目で見ちゃうわよ？」=“Jeez... This onee-chan will actually get disgusted for real. Are you alright with that? Do you want me to look at you with those kinds of eyes?”
「あ……ふふっ、こういうのは嬉しいかも……」=“Ah... Fufu, this makes me happy...”
「はわっ、な、ナデナデ繰り返されると……甘えたくなっちゃう……」=“Hawa... I-If you keep patting me like that... I'll become spoiled...”
「さすがに恥ずかしいわよ。ほら、私だってもう立派に大人な女性なんだからー！」=“That's really embarrassing. After all, I'm a proper mature woman too--!”
「ひゃんっ……触られちゃっ……た……♪」=“Hyan~... I got felt... up... ♪”
「うーん、何が目的なのかしら？　ほっぺたの柔らかさは胸と一緒……じゃないわよね？」=“Hmm, I wonder what your aim is? You're not comparing the softness of my cheeks to my chest... right?”
「もうダメ！　ほっぺた触られる度にキスされるんじゃないかってドキドキするんだからー！」=“Cut it out with that! I'm getting too excited just wondering if you're going to kiss me every time you touch my cheeks!”
「そういうことするなら、きちんと仲直りした後じゃないと嫌……かな」=“Unless you're gonna apologize and make up with me, doing something like that is a bit... I don't like it.”
「キミの近くにいればいるほどキミのこと好きになっちゃう。魔法みたいね」=“I've fallen in love with you to the point that just being next to you is enough. It's like magic.”
「キミが男の子だから……なのかな。私、いつも胸がドキドキして……身体、熱くなっちゃうの……」=“I wonder if it's because you're a boy... When I'm with you, my chest always starts throbbing... and my body becomes hot...”
「キミのこと、全部知りたくなっちゃった。たくさんお話しましょ？」=“I've become even more interested in you, to the point of wanting to know everything about you. Let's talk lots, okay?”
「ふふっ、キミのお顔をじっくり見てもいい時間ね。へぇ……肌綺麗なんだ……」=“Fufu, just gazing at your face is fun as well. Heh... it's so pretty...”
「私とは話すこともない……ってことかしら？」=“Is it that... there's nothing to talk about with me?”
「私、ちょっと限界かも……お互いに一度頭を冷やしてみましょう」=“I... think I've hit my limit... Let's both take some time to cool off.”
「ね……どうして私がこんな気分なのか……分かってくれる……わよね？　そうじゃなきゃ……ううん、なんでもない。それじゃ」=“Hey... I wonder why I'm feeling like this... you understand... right? If not... No, it's nothing. Then, see ya.”
「どうしてかしら？　どんどんキミの傍に近づきたくなっちゃう。私、引き寄せられてるみたい……またお話しましょうね」=“I wonder why it is? For some reason, I keep wanting to get even closer to you... It feels like I'm being pulled... Let's talk again sometime, alright?”
「あのね……キミといると、私、初めての気持ちになるの……大きな声じゃ言えない気持ちよ？　あはは、それじゃ、またね！」=“Hey, you know... When I'm with you, I feel these feelings that I've never felt before... Feelings that I can't say out loud... Ahaha, then, let's meet again!”
「ふふっ、そろそろ切り上げないといつまでも話しちゃいそうね。また次も楽しみにしてるわね」=“Fufu, if we don't cut it short here, we'll keep talking forever. I'm looking forward to the next time~”
「残念だけどここでお別れ。また話したいな……」=“It's a shame but we'll have to say goodbye here. I hope we can chat later again...”
「ここまでかしらね。また今度、ゆっくり話しましょう？」=“I suppose that's that then. Let's take it much slower later?”
「うん、このままだとずーっと話しちゃいそうだものね。またいつでも声をかけて」=“Yeah, at this rate, we'll end up talking all day. Call for me again sometime.”
「ええ、それじゃ。またね」=“Alright, then, next time.”
「もう……本当に男の子なんだから……でも……うん、いいわよ♪」=“Jeez... Boys are always... But... Yeah, It's alright ♪”
「うーん……今はちょっと、かな……」=“Nnn... now's a bit, you know...”
「あのね……私、キミとエッチ……したいな……」=“Hey, Uhm... I, I want to have sex... with you...”
「良かったぁ……だって、こういうこと聞くのってすごく緊張するんですもの」=“I'm so glad... I mean, asking something like this, It makes me really nervous.”
「あ……ひどい……女の子に恥をかかせたな。罪な人ー」=“Ah... So heartless... You've made me so embarrassed. What a sinful man.”
「あのさ、俺、ここで[H名]とエッチしたいんだ」=“Hey, Listen, I really wanna have sex with you, [H名], right here.”
「こんな場所で……もうヘンタイさんね……って、ふふっ、私もしたいんだけど♪」=“In a place like this... You're such a pervert... Well, Fufu, It's not like I don't want to do it either ♪”
「あのね、キミは世間体と欲望のバランスを考えた方がいいわ。こんなとこじゃダーメ」=“Hey, you should think properly about balancing your desires and public decency. Doing it in this place is no good.”
「うそ……万が一人のことがあったら……って、ふふっ、それも楽しそうね。いいわよ、しましょ♪」=“No way... What if someone walks in... Well, Fufu, That sounds fun in its own way. Alright, let's do it ♪”
「もう……こういうところは安心して出来ないからダメなの。エッチはゆっくりしっかりするもの、でしょ？」=“Jeez... We can't do it in a place like this, I can't relax here. Sex is something we should take our time with and do properly, no?”
「いいわね。私も買い物しようと思ってたの」=“Sounds good. I was thinking of going shopping too.”
「キミと一緒にお土産を見に行きたいんだけど、どうかしら？」=“I want to go do a bit of souvenir hunting with you, how about it?”
「よかった、ほら、早速見に行きましょ？」=“Great, c'mon, let's go already?”
「そう、キミと行きたかったんだけどなー……」=“I see, I really wanted to go with you though~...”
「賛成ね。たくさん遊びましょう？」=“I don't see why not. Let's have lots of fun?”
「ねぇ、これから二人で遊ばない？」=“Hey, can we go have some fun together right now?”

「ふふっ、そう来なくっちゃ♪」=“Fufuh--, that's my boy♪”
「あら、行けない理由でもあるのかしら、残念ね……」=“Oh my, any reason you can't? What a shame...”
「あら、キミってエスパー？　お腹が空いてたから、私も誘おうと思ってたの」=“Oh my, are you a psychic, by any chance? I was feeling hungry, so I was just about to come to you.”
「キミが美味しく食べる姿、見てみたいなー……？」=“I want to watch you gobble down tasty food, could I~...?”
「やった、となれば、沢山美味しいもの食べましょ？」=“Yay, let's eat lots and lots of good stuff then?”
「ちぇー、残念……」=“Tsk~, you're no fun...”
