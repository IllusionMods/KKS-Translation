「ほんと、いろんなアクティビティがあるよねぇ」=“There's seriously a whole lot of things to do here, huh?”
「まぁ時間はあるんだし、片っ端から回っていくだけよ？」=“Well, it's not like we're short on time so, it's just a matter of doing it all, you know?”
「この島を満喫するためにもいろんな事をやってみたいよね」=“You wanna do all sorts of stuff here too, don't you? We can't say we enjoyed our time here otherwise.”
「そうね、食事から観光、アクティビティまでいろいろと制覇していきたいわ」=“Yeah, from the sights to the food, and even the various activities, I wanna conquer them all.”
「この島の全てを堪能する頃には滅茶苦茶体力付いてそうだな……」=“I bet we're gonna have enough stamina to run a marathon by the time we're done enjoying everything here...”
「まぁそれはそれで健康的だし、いいんじゃないかしら？」=“Well, that sounds pretty healthy in its own way, so isn't it fine?”
「折角のアクティビティ、できれば気の合う人と楽しみたいよね」=“It'd be nice to do all these activities with someone you get along with, wouldn't it?”
「ふふっ、私はいつでも大歓迎よ？　もちろんタイミングが合えば、だけど」=“Fufuh--, I'm always down for something, you know? Of course, if our schedules match, that is.”
「もう、この島に住むこと自体が１つのアクティビティだよね」=“Just living here is like an activity in itself, isn't it?”
「確かに、言われてみればそうかも……？」=“Now that you say it, maybe...?”
「俺たちが在住してる間に新しいアクティビティとか増えたりして……」=“Imagine if they started running even more activities while we're still here....”
「案外、私達が申請したら検討してくれたりするかも……？」=“They might actually, if we put in some applications of our own...?”
「やっぱり、こう自然が多いと空気が違うよね」=“The air really is just different with this much nature around, isn't it?”
「そうね、何かこう、濃度が高い……っていうのかしら？」=“Yeah, it feels somehow, thicker... I suppose?”
「この自然の中で生活するって、普段からじゃ想像しにくかったなぁ」=“Man, before we came here, I could have never imagined what living in a place like this would be like.”
「まぁ、普段の生活に慣れてるとさすがにギャップはあったわね」=“Well, it really is all a bit distant from the sort of lives we lived back home, isn't it?”
「さすがに初めて見る自然物が多いよなぁ」=“There seriously are a whole lot of things here that I'm seeing for the first time.”
「地域、環境的な違いを実感させてくれるわよね」=“It really makes you realize the difference between the region and the environment here, doesn't it?”
「ここの自然って全て原生種なのかな？」=“I wonder if all the nature here has always been here?”
「どうかしらね、多少は外来種もありそうだけど……詳しくはわからないわ」=“Who could say, I feel like there's probably atleast a few introduced species but... I don't know, honestly.”
「自然と共に生きるって簡単な事じゃないよね」=“It's not easy living within nature, is it?”
「でも、ここの人々はそれが当たり前なのよね。慣れってすごいと思うわ」=“Yeah, but to the people here, it's something they do everyday, isn't it? I think it's amazing what people can get used to.”
「島の人すら見たことのない生き物っていたりするのかな？」=“I wonder if there's any animals here that even the locals haven't seen?”
「そういうのを探し出すの、とてもロマンがあると思わない？」=“Don't you think it sounds just downright adventurous, to try and find one of those?”
「綺麗な海、見てるだけで心が安らぐよね」=“Just looked at the pretty sea here is enough to sooth your heart, isn't it?”
「静かな波の音もリラクゼーションとしての効果が出てるんだと思うわ」=“I think the sounds from those waves also contribute to the relaxation effect.”
「あれだけ綺麗な海ならいくらでも入っていられそうだな」=“With a sea that pretty, you could go for a dip everyday.”
「ほどほどにしておきなさいよ？　まぁ気持ちはわからないでもないけど……」=“Don't overdo it, okay? I mean, it's not like I don't get how you feel though...”
「こういう海の生物って、ほんと色鮮やかだよね」=“The sea creatures here are all very vividly colored, aren't they?”
「そうね。　まぁ等の本人たち？　にとってはただの保護色や警戒色のなんだけどね」=“Yeah. Well, to them, it's probably just camoflauge or warning colors and the like.”
「これだけ綺麗な海を維持するのって簡単な事じゃないよね」=“It's probably not easy to maintain a sea this pretty, is it?”
「そうね、浜辺から海中と、とてつもない範囲を見張らなきゃいけないものね」=“Yeah. From the seashore to the sea itself, you have to watch over a wide area, afterall.”
「海での食べ物といったら何が浮かぶ？」=“What comes to mind when you hear "food at the beach"?”
「そうねぇ……私はやっぱり海の家での焼きそばかな？　あのくったくたなのが好きなのよ」=“Let's see... I suppose for me, it'd be yakisoba at a beachside hut? I just love that relaxed and lazy mood, you know?”
「ああいう透明度の高い海って本当にしょっぱいの？　とか思っちゃわない？」=“With how see-through the seawater here is, doesn't it make you question whether it's actually salty or not?”
「で、油断して口に入った時のギャップがすごいのよね……」=“Yep, and when you let your guard down and some goes into your mouth, it's a real shocker, isn't it...”
「友達にお土産を買うとしたら何を選ぶ？」=“If you had to pick a souvenir out for a friend, what'd you go for?”
「ん―……私だったら無難にご当地食べ物系かな？」=“Nnn... personally, I'd say I'm the type to go for the safe, local sweets type of girl?”
「観光地だし、普段目にしないようなものに惹かれるよね」=“With how touristy this place is, you just can't help but have your eyes drawn to the unique things here, can you?”
「うんうん、やっぱり特別感があるからかしらね？」=“Yepyep, I suppose it's because it feels special, isn't it?”
「こういうところの民芸品といったら、何か魔除け的な効果とかあったりするのかな？」=“Talking about the local crafts here, I wonder if any of them have any evil warding effects?”
「どうかしらね？　魔除けというかまじないかしらね？　幸運を呼んだりとか」=“Who knows? Probably charms atleast, no? Good luck ones and whatnot.”
「この島の食べ物や飲み物ってなかなか特徴的だよね」=“The food and drinks here are really unique, aren't they?”
「そうね、極端に甘かったりすっぱかったり……でもそれが癖になっちゃったりするのよね」=“Yeah, sometimes ridiculously sweet, sometimes ridiculously sour, they only do extremes here... but that's what's addicting about it, you know?”
「珍しいものが多くて、目移りしちゃうよね」=“There's so many rare and unique things here, they drag your eyes whether you want them to or not, don't they?”
「でもつい買い過ぎちゃったりすると置き場に困ったりするのよね……」=“But on the other hand, you buy too many things and suddenly you don't have space for anything anymore...”
「やっぱり、買い物をするなら思い出になるようなものがいいよね」=“Man, if we're gonna buy something, better to buy memorable stuff, isn't it?”
「えぇ、一目見てこの島の事を思い出せるものにしたいわね」=“Yes, I'd rather buy just things that'll remind me of this island with a single glance.”
「開放的な島に来たら、やっぱり開放的な事したいよね」=“On a nice and liberating island like this, it'd be pretty nice to do some pretty open and liberating stuff, wouldn't it?”
「なぁに？　それってつまり、エッチも開放的になりたいってことかしら？」=“What~? Are you saying that you want our sex to be liberating too?”
「これだけ自然が多いと……隠れてするにはもってこいだよね」=“With this much nature around us... it's basically asking us to do it in there, isn't it?”
「こーら、不健全だぞ？　……まぁちょっとは興奮しちゃうかもしれないけど」=“Hey~, that's unwholesome, you know? ....Well, I'm not gonna say that it won't arouse me even a bit though.”
「さんさんと輝く太陽の元でのエッチ……」=“Having sex where the sun shines the brightest....”
「いろんな意味で熱くなりすぎて熱中症になっちゃうかも……？　した後はしっかり水分取らないとね」=“We might end up getting so hot and sweaty that we get heatstroke, you know...? We'll have to consume lots of water afterwards.”
「もう、変な事言わないの」=“Jeez, don't say weird stuff.”
「んー、まだ私には早いかな……？」=“Nn~, that's still a bit too early for me, I'd say...?”
