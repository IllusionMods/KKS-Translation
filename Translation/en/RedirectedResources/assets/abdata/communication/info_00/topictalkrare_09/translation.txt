「ホエールウォッチングってどうなんだろう？」=“I wonder what whale watching's like.”
「ホエール？　……ああ、あれね、安全のためには大事なことだと思うわ」=“A whale? ...Aah, that, I think it's very important for safety's sake, certainly.”
「確かウチの車も先月だかが車検だったし」=“If I'm remembering right, we took our own car for inspection last month or so.”
「車検……安全？　わかった！　ホイール！　ホイールの点検って解釈したのか！！」=“Inspection... safety? I got it! The wheels! So you took what I said to mean wheel inspection, did you!!”
「フフン」=“Fufuhn~”
「威張ってるけど、俺が驚いたのは君が思ってる理由とは違うからね」=“You're swaggering about but, the reason I'm shocked is completely different to the one you're thinking, just so you know.”
「この辺りはヤシガニがいるみたいだよ」=“Seems like there's coconut crabs around these parts.”
「ヤシガニって……あ、あれでしょ？　わしわししてる。地球外生物みたいな」=“Coconut crabs are... t-those things, right? Those alien looking, clickity clackity things?”
「まあ、言いたいことはちょっとわかる」=“Well, I can certainly see what image you have of them.”
「テレビで見たことあるわ！　特に裏が怖いのよ。ひっくり返したら、ヒッて声出ちゃうやつよ」=“I've seen them on TV before! Their backsides are especially scary. If you turn them over, they make this hiiih sound.”
「あれはもう、そう！　ほとんどエビね」=“They're almost, yeah! They're more or less lobsters, aren't they?”
「うん、そこはさすがにカニだよね」=“No, well, they're crabs.”
「月桃っていい匂いだよね」=“Shell gingers smell really nice, don't they?”
「げっとー？　ああ、あの花ね。ちょっとわかるかも」=“Shell gingers? Aah, those flowers, huh? I think I know.”
「あれなんの匂いなんだろう」=“I wonder what smell that actually is.”
「……月桃の匂いよ！」=“...Shell ginger smell, dummy!”
「そうだけど、俺が言いたいのはそういうことじゃなくて……」=“I mean, yeah but, that's not what I mean to say...”
「印象的な香りよね。きっと、この土地を離れてもふと思い出しちゃうと思うわ」=“They've got a real impactful smell, don't they? I'm sure something with trigger the memory of them, even once we leave this place.”
「まあ、はい」=“Well, basically, that.”
「ヤマネコって天然記念物らしいね？」=“Seems like wildcats are a protected species, huh?”
「天然記念物……って、よく聞くけど実際はどうやって保護されてるの？」=“Protected species... they say that a lot but how exactly do they protect them anyway?”
「住む場所提供したり、子供ができるようにお見合いさせたりとか？　……かな」=“Give them a place to live in, and bring them to meet each other so they can have kids and whatnot? ...I guess.”
「へー、お見合いまでいくとちょっと過保護な感じもするけど」=“Heh, that almost sounds like a bit of helicopter parenting too, though, making them meet up and stuff.”
「絶対数が少ないと相手にめぐりあうのも大変、とかだからじゃない？」=“Isn't it because since their numbers are so low, they would never naturally end up meeting each other?”
「そう……でも、やっぱり生涯の伴侶とは運命的に出会いたいじゃない」=“I see... but still, I'd still wanna meet up with my lifepartner in a fateful sort of way.”
「たとえば？」=“Like for example?”
「ぐいぐいこないでよ、もうっ。デリカシーがないんだから。ヤマネコよりあたしを手厚く保護すべきだわ」=“Don't ask me so many things, dummy--. You're such a blockhead. You ought to protect me snugly more than a wildcat.”
「さっき、過保護は嫌みたいなこと言ってたような……」=“Somehow I remember you saying that you don't like overprotectiveness just a bit ago...”
「この辺りは流星群が見られるんだよ」=“Apparently you can see meteor showers around here.”
「流星……ああ、流れ星のことね！」=“Meteor... Aah, you mean shooting stars, huh!”
「うん、そう言ったつもりだった」=“Yeah, that's what I meant.”
「いっぱい星が降ってくるんでしょ？　壮大ね。いい感じだわ」=“A whole lot of stars are gonna shoot past, right? Sounds grand. I like that.”
「でも、そんなに気前よく降らせて平気かしら」=“But, is it really okay to let so many of them fall so generously?”
「見えやすい見え辛いがあるだけで、星は常に降ってるらしいよ」=“Apparently stars are always falling up in the sky, it's just a matter of them being easy or hard to see.”
「そうなの？　ふぅん、なかなかやるわね」=“Really? Hmmm, pretty impressive.”
「それは誰を讃えてるの？」=“Who's that praise for there?”
「宇宙」=“The universe.”
「サガリバナは一夜だけ花をつけるんだよ」=“Mango pines only bloom for one night, you know.”
「らしいわね。なんだか儚い命だわ……ちょっとかわいそう」=“Seems like it, yeah. What a short life... I almost feel bad.”
「かもしれないけど、他の花になれるわけじゃないしね……」=“It might be short but, it's not like they can just turn into a different flower, so...”
「サガリバナはサガリバナとして懸命に咲くだけ、ってことね？」=“So you're saying that all they can do is bloom their short but wonderful lives as Mango pines, huh?”
「いいじゃない、素敵よ今の」=“Pretty good, I'm impressed.”
「俺がそんな感じにまとめたわけでは……」=“I didn't really come up with that though...”
「なら、合作かしら。どのみちいいフィーリングだったわ」=“A joint production then. Either way, it had a nice feeling to it.”
「がぜん、興味が湧いてきちゃった。見に行きましょ」=“Suddenly, I feel interested in these flowers. Let's go look at them.”
「そう簡単に見られるものではないんだよね」=“It's not that easy to just "go and look at them", you know?”
「この前、鳥の雛が孵ってたよ」=“The other day, I had a chick hatch.”
「雛って……なんの？　鶏？」=“A chick... of what? Like a chicken chick?”
「鶏ではないね。多分、この島に住んでる野鳥だよ」=“Not a chicken, no. Probably the chick of a wild bird native to this place.”
「お母さんがいない子だったの？　なら、あなたが親ってことね」=“Did it not have a mommy? I guess that makes you the parent then.”
「なんでそうなるのさ。普通に親いると思うよ」=“How did you get that from what I said? I'm pretty sure it's got a mommy.”
「なんだ、見てただけ？」=“What, you were just looking after it?”
「がっかりの理由がわからない」=“I'm not sure why you're so disappointed.”
「がっかりはしてないけど。一緒に育てよう、ってことかと思ったから……びっくりしちゃって」=“I'm not disappointed. I just thought you were gonna ask if I wanted to raise it together... so it caught me off guard.”
「こっちも結構びっくりだよ」=“I'm pretty surprised here myself, alright.”
「最近、世話してたアサガオがやっと咲いたんだ」=“This morning glory I've been looking after for a while finally bloomed.”
「へー……ああ、もしかして庭に咲いてたあれ？」=“Hoh... aah, you mean the one growing in the yard?”
「そうそう。キレイな青い花で感動しちゃった」=“Yep, that one. It bloomed into such a pretty blue flower, seeing it moved me.”
「誘ってくれたらあたしも手伝ったのに」=“If you'd just asked me, I'd have helped you raise it too.”
「残念。二人でお世話してたら、感動ももっと大きかったかもね」=“Shame. If we raised it together, it might have been even more moving.”
「そんな、夫婦の初めての共同作業みたいな言い方……」=“You're almost making it sound like the first joint activity between a married couple...”
「ま、まあ、今からでも間に合うかもしれないし。試してみる？」=“W-Well, it might still not be too late. Wanna give it a shot?”
「間に合うかなぁ……」=“It's already bloomed though...”
「マンタってエイの仲間なんだってね」=“Mantas are apparently the relatives of rays.”
「物を知らないのね？　あんなのどう見てもエイじゃない」=“You're pretty unaware, huh? Obviously they are, have you ever looked at one?”
「大きいのは横幅、8メートルとかあるんだよ？　エイのスケールじゃなくない？」=“They get as big as 8 meters, you know? Aren't rays much smaller than that?”
「思ってたよりずっと大きかった！？」=“What the heck!? That big?!”
「ほとんど怪獣ね。も、もしかしたら火も吐くかも……」=“That's almost monster sized. T-They might even breathe fire...”
「水の中で？」=“Underwater?”
「海ほたるはシーズンで見やすさが変わるんだって」=“Apparently sea fireflies come and go depending upon the season.”
「へえ、いつが旬なの？」=“Hoh, when's their hayday then?”
「初夏から初秋にかけてが、一般的なシーズンみたい」=“Apparently, they're common from early summer to early autumn, in general.”
「じゃあ、今はいい時期だったんだ。あたし達、ラッキーじゃない！」=“We're in just the right season then. We're pretty darn lucky, huh!”
「運命を感じるね」=“Feels like fate, doesn't it?”
「ど、どういう意味での運命よっ」=“H-Heck do you mean by fate--!”
「ウミガメってどんなイメージ？」=“What sort of image do you have of sea turtles?”
「鉄板のやつがあるでしょ？　泣きながら卵をプリプリ産む生き物よ」=“There's really only image you can have, no? The one of them laying eggs while crying the whole time.”
「俺もそれだなぁ。本当に泣くんだよなね、ウミガメ」=“Same for me. They really do cry a lot, don't they?”
「でも、あたしに言わせれば卵産みがら泣くからなんなの？　って感じよ」=“But personally if you ask me, what's the big deal in crying while laying eggs anyway?”
「人間だって泣くでしょ。ウミガメだけが特別じゃないわ」=“Humans cry too, no? Sea turtles aren't special in that regard.”
「ま、まぁ、そうかもね。しかし女性は大変だよなぁ。本当、頭が下がるよ……」=“W-Well, you're not wrong. Still, women really have it tough, don't they? Seriously, as a guy, I have massive respect...”
「べ、別に、あんたのために赤ちゃん産んであげるなんて言ってないじゃない」=“N-No need to, it's not like I've offered to give birth to your babies or anything.”
「俺もそんなこと言ってないけど」=“I didn't say that either though.”
「星の砂ってロマンチックだよね」=“Starsand is really romantic, isn't it?”
「ああ、あの……瓶に入ってる」=“Aah, that... stuff in bottles, right?”
「そうそれ。お土産とかでも人気らしいよ」=“Yep, exactly that. Apparently it's pretty popular as a souvenir.”
「ふぅん。ねぇ？　星の砂を持ってるとどうなる、とかはあるんだったかしら」=“Hmmm. Hey? Is there something like "holding onto starsand does whatever" behind it or what?”
「おまじないみたいなこと？　多分、ないと思うけど」=“Like a charm of some kind? Probably not, I don't think.”
「どうせなら、星の砂に向かって祈ると願いが叶うとかだったらいいのにね」=“If it's something you carry around anyway, it'd have been nice if praying to it would make your wish come true or whatever.”
「う、うーん……流れ星に比べると、効果は薄そうなきがするなぁ、それ」=“N-Nnnn... I feel like compared to shooting stars, such an effect would be minor at best.”
「ウムイの鐘って、いつもカップルでいっぱいなんだってよ」=“Apparently the Bell of Umuy gets lots of couples frequenting it daily.”
「それはそうでしょ、目玉スポットだもの」=“Of course it does, it's a centerpiece of this island.”
「そういう意味では、鐘のジンクスは当たってるって決まったようなものよね」=“In that sense, the spell behind the bell working's almost a foregone conclusion, isn't it?”
「なんで？」=“How so?”
「だって、二人で鐘を鳴らそうって決めた時点で願いが叶ったようなものじゃない」=“I mean, the moment you decide to ring it together, the spell's already come true, no?”
（ピュア～……）=(So pure~...)
「男が胸を見てるとすぐわかるとか言うけど……」=“They say that girls can tell right away when a guy looks at their chest but...”
「当然でしょ？　特にあたしの察知能力は忍者並みなんだから」=“Obviously? Especially me, my sense for that is ninja-tier.”
「じゃあ、今日だけで俺が何回胸を見てたか当ててみて」=“Then, try guessing just how many times I've looked at yours just today.”
「見てたの！？　えっち。ていうか、なんのカミングアウトよそれ」=“You looked at it!? You perv. Heck, what sort of a confession is that even?”
「……全然、気付いてないじゃん」=“...You didn't notice at all, the hell?”
「そうね。た、多分、あんただと気を許しちゃうから……かも」=“Guess I didn't. I-It's probably that, since it's you, my body doesn't mind... I think.”
「自分のフェチって、思い当たることある？」=“Can you think of any of your own fetishes?”
「フェチって胸フェチとか髪フェチとかそういうのでしょ？　ないわよ」=“You mean like having a thing for boobs or for hair or whatever else, right? I don't have those.”
「絶対ないって言い切れるかな～？」=“Can you really say that with that much confidence though~?”
「詰め寄ってこないでよ。し、知らないったらぁ……」=“Don't press me. I-I really don't know~...”
（意外とマゾっ気はありそうだな……）=(A real submissive side to her, doesn't she?...)
「あんたのフェチを教えてあげる。女の子困らせフェチよ」=“I'll tell you yours though. You've got a thing for pestering your girlfriend.”
「そうだ。欲求不満な時って、どうしてるの？」=“Right. What do you do when you feel sexually frustrated?”
「サラッと聞かないでよ！　欲求不満って……それ、どういう状況のことよ」=“Don't just ask me that like it's nothing! What do you even... mean by "sexually frustrated" anyway?”
「ムラムラする時？　触って欲しい時とかは、自分でしてるのかなって」=“Like when you're horny? I was just wondering if you touch yourself when you start craving it or whatever.”
「す、するわけないでしょ！　そんなことしたらエッチな子じゃない」=“O-Of course I don't! I'd be such a lewd girl if I did that stuff.”
「じゃあ、我慢するんだ？」=“You endure it then?”
「そうよ、ムラムラしても我慢。あたしは並外れた忍耐力があるから」=“That's right, I endure it even when I feel horny. I've got the devil's endurance, you know.”
（ムラムラすることはあるんだ……）=(So she does get horny, huh...)
「どうしても意識しちゃうな。俺達、その……しちゃったんだよね？」=“It's hard to not think about it, you know? We really, uhm... did that, didn't we?”
「はっきり言わないでよ。顔、熱くなっちゃうから考えないようにしてたのに」=“Don't say it so directly. I've been trying not to think about it too, since it makes my face all red.”
「俺もそうしたいんだけど、どうしても思い出しちゃって」=“I want to do the same but, I just can't help thinking back to it.”
「どのシーンのことよ。えいえい、ってしてた時？」=“Thinking back to which part? Like when you were going at it?”
「顔ばっかり浮かんでくるかな？　可愛かったから。あとは、肌の温もりとか……」=“It's always just your face, I guess? You were seriously adorable. Also, your warmth and whatnot...”
「だからぁ、意識させないでったら」=“I told you, don't make me think of it, dummy.”
「……ごめん」=“...Sorry.”
「そ、そんなに真面目に謝らなくてもいいわよ。意識してくれるの……嬉しいし」=“You don't have to apologize so earnestly. I'm happy... you're thinking about me.”
「意識するのは嫌なのに？」=“Even though you don't like it?”
「照れちゃうってだけよ。あんたのこと想うのが嫌なわけない、から……」=“It just makes me blush, that's all. It's not like I mind, thinking about you, you know...”
