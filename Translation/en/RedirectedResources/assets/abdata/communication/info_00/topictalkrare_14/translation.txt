「ホエールウォッチングって楽しそうだよね」=“Whale watching sounds really fun, doesn't it?”
「クジラ見んのか？　双眼鏡で」=“Watching whales, huh? With what, binoculars?”
「もうちょっと近くでかな。船の横とか泳いでるのが見られるらしいよ」=“Closer than that, I think. Seems like it involves a whole boat ride right up to the side of one.”
「……近すぎんだろ。クジラって意外と警戒心ねぇんだな」=“...That's way too close. Whales aren't all that wary, huh?”
「まあ、どうにかされるとは思ってないんだろうね」=“Well, they probably don't think that all that much is gonna happen.”
「調子乗ってんのか」=“Now that's too much.”
「クジラをそういう目で見る人、あんまりいないと思うよ」=“I don't think there's that many people out there, that think like that about whales.”
「ヤシガニは世界最大級の甲殻類なんだって」=“Apparently coconut crabs are the biggest, as far as crustaceans go.”
「てっぺんとってんのかよ。なかなかやるじゃねぇか」=“They've got the throne, huh? That's something.”
「で？　どんくらいでけぇんだよ」=“So? How big are they?”
「平均で体長４０cmくらいだったかな？」=“On average, around 40cm, if I remember right?”
「ンだよ、子犬くらいのもんじゃねぇか。ビビってんなよ」=“The hell? That's 'bout as big as a puppy. Don't get scared of something like that.”
「子犬くらいある甲殻類ってなかなかのものだよ……」=“A crab being as big as a puppy is a pretty big deal, you know...”
「月桃ってキレイだよね」=“Shell gingers are really pretty, aren't they?”
「なんだっけ？　……ああ、トイレの匂いみたいなのがする花か」=“What now? ...Aaah, that flower that smells like a toilet, huh?”
「そういうことは思っても言わない方がいいと思う」=“Even if you think that way, you should keep stuff like that yourself, I think.”
「私に乙女心みたいなのを求めてくんじゃねぇよ。やんのか」=“Don't come expecting me to grow a girly side. Ya wanna go?”
「わかった、ごめん。トイレの匂いでいいよ」=“No, sorry, my bad. Yeah, it does smell like a toilet.”
「……それはそれで、私らの力関係に花を巻き込むなよって思わなくもねぇな」=“...At the same time though, no point in dragging a flower in the middle of our power relationship.”
「ヤマネコって強そうだよね」=“Wildcats look real strong, don't they?”
「ああ！　飼い慣らされた猫とは違う野性味ってもんをヤツからは感じるぜ」=“Yeah! I can feel a whole different sorta wildness from them that tamed cats just don't have.”
「実際、野生の存在だしね」=“I mean, they're wild animals, afterall.”
「イカすよな、あいつ。どっかにいねぇかな」=“They're real cool, aren't they? Wonder if ya can find one around here.”
「猫好きなの？　へえ、ちょっと意外」=“You like cats? Huh, I didn't expect that.”
「はああ？　好きとか言ってぇし。舐めてんなよ」=“Haah? When did I say that? Them's fighting words.”
「いや、さっき可愛いって自分で……」=“But, didn't you call them cute yoursel...”
「お膝に乗せたいとか、ぜってぇ思ってねぇし」=“I ain't thinkin' that I wanna let one sleep on my lap at all.”
（お膝って言った……）=(Her lap, huh...)
「流星群ってロマンの塊だよね」=“Meteor showers feel like just concentrated romance, don't they?”
「私バカだから、ロマンとか言われてもあんまピンとこねぇけど……」=“I'm an idiot so, I don't really get what you mean by "romance" there...”
「宇宙ってすげぇな、とかは感じなくもない」=“It does make me think, "Man, space sure is amazing", and all.”
「それがロマンなんじゃないの？」=“Isn't that it though?”
「マジかよ。私、いつの間にかロマン掴んでたか」=“For real? And you grabbed the romance before you knew it.”
「掴むっていうか、まあ、はい」=“In your hands", well, yes.”
「……次はオーロラとかか」=“...I guess up next would be auroras.”
「次の意味がよくわかりません」=“I cannot say I'm following.”
「サガリバナってどう思う？」=“What do you think of Mango Pines?”
「一晩だけ咲く花とかだったか？　どうって聞かれてもなぁ……」=“Were they those one-night-only flowers? I mean, even if you ask me...”
「頑張ってんなって感じか？　セミみてぇなもんだろ」=“I guess they're doing their best? Like cicadas or whatever.”
「言いたいことはわかるけど、もうちょっとこう……なんだろ」=“I get what you're going for but, can't you like say it more like... you know?”
「私にそういうの期待するなっての」=“Don't expect such things from me.”
「実際に見たら、また印象も違うんじゃない？」=“If you actually got to see one, wouldn't that change your impression too?”
「セミの羽化なら見たことあるぜ」=“I've seen cicadas sprouting wings and flying around.”
「どう思ったの？」=“What did it make you think?”
「……セミだな、って思った」=“..."Those are cicadas alright", that's about it.”
（……サガリバナ見ても同じこと言いそう）=(...I feel like she'd say the same thing about the flowers.)
「この前、鳥の巣の雛が孵ってたよ」=“The other day, I had this little birdie hatch on me, in this birds' nest.”
「鳥？　ああ、そういやこの辺りは野鳥が多いんだってな」=“A bird? Aah, come to think of it, a helluva lot of wild birds around here, huh?”
「ちっちゃくて可愛いよ」=“It's really tiny and adorable.”
「お、お前、可愛いとか……そういうの私には似合わねぇの知ってんだろ」=“Y-You... you know "adorable" stuff or whatever doesn't fit me.”
「嫌いじゃないくせに。ちょっと見てみたいなぁ、とか思ってない？」=“You know you love it. You sure you don't wanna look at it once?”
「思ってねぇよ」=“Damn sure.”
「可愛いものが好きなら好きで、別におかしくないと思うけど」=“I don't think it's all that weird to love cute things though.”
「言ってねぇだろ誰もそんなことよォ！」=“Who the hell said that I love cute things!?”
「すごい怒る……」=“So mad...”
「そういえば、庭のアサガオがやっと咲いたんだ」=“Reminds me, the morning glory I've been looking after at the yard finally bloomed.”
「アサガオってお前……一人で観察日記でもつけてたのかよ」=“A morning glory... did you make an observation diary by yourself or something?”
「言われると思った。違うって、お世話してただけ」=“I knew you'd say that. It's nothing like that, I was just looking after it.”
「どうせ帰んのにそんなことしても、情が湧いちまうだけだろ」=“We're gonna go home eventually, you know? Stuff like that's just gonna make you attached to this place.”
「そんな、野良犬とかじゃないんだから」=“No way, it's not like it's a stray dog or anything.”
「まあ、でも、うん、お前そういう似合うな。なんか納得しちまった」=“But, well, yeah, it does fit you. Yeah, fits your image.”
「それはどういう意味での似合うなの？」=“And just how does it fit my image?”
「マメっつーか、そんな感じ？　別にけなしたわけじゃねぇよ」=“It's kinda childish, I guess? Not that I'm disparaging you or anything, so you know.”
「ちょっと笑ってるけどね」=“I can see you grinning though.”
「マンタって水族館の人気物だよね」=“Mantas are real superstars at the aquarium, aren't they?”
「マンタってあれだろ？　でっかいエイ……みたいな」=“You mean those ones, right? Those big... ray like things.”
「そうそれ。ダイビングとかで潜ったら、けっこう会えるらしいよ」=“Yep, those. Apparently you can even get right up close to them, if you go diving.”
「……ダイビングねぇ」=“...Diving, huh?”
「そっちに興味あるの？」=“Interested?”
「いや、そこまでしてエイを見たがるとか物好きなヤツが多いなと思っただけ」=“No, I just thought that there sure are a lot of fancy pants people who go that far to just look at a ray.”
「ドライすぎ」=“Live a little.”
「海ほたるって知ってる？　波がピカピカ光る……」=“You know sea fireflies? The things that glow in the sea...”
「ああ、あれだろ？　知ってるぜ」=“Aah, those, right? I know.”
「すごいよね、あれ」=“They're amazing, right?”
「すごいかもしんねぇけど、ああいうのは誰かと実際に見てなんぼって気もするな」=“They might be but, that sorta thing's something you gotta look at with someone else, I feel like.”
「いつにする？」=“When do you wanna go?”
「そ、そういう意味で言ったんじゃねぇよ。調子乗ってんのか！」=“I-I didn't say it with that meaning. You getting carried away!?”
（照れ隠しが怖い……）=(Her shy side is scary...)
「ウミガメって意外と泳ぐの上手だよね」=“Sea turtles are surprisingly good at swimming, aren't they?”
「知らねぇよ。てか、あいつらあんなんで泳げんのかよ」=“Don't ask me. Heck, can they really swim with those things?”
「普通にスイスイ泳いでるよ」=“It's not that weird, they use them like arms.”
「どんくさそうなのにな。人は見かけによらない、ってことか」=“You'd think they'd be piss slow. I guess people ain't all what they seem.”
（人ではないけど……）=(They're not people though...)
「意外と力も強かったりしてな」=“They look surprisingly tough too.”
「さあ？　海藻が主食だから人を噛んだりはしないようなことを何かで見たけど」=“Do they? I once read somewhere that since all they eat is seaweed, they don't really bite people.”
「なんだ、泳ぐだけか」=“So what, do they just swim around?”
「他に何を期待したのかかがちょっと気になるね」=“I'm curious what more you expected from them.”
「星の砂ってお土産としてはどうなのかな？」=“How's starsand as a souvenir?”
「あの小瓶みたいなやつか？　私がもらったら……うーん、微妙か？」=“You mean that tiny bottle of that stuff? If someone gifted me one... Nnn, I'd look at them weird, I guess?”
「きみに似合うと思って、って言われたら？」=“What if they say that they bought it because it suits you?”
「舐めてんじゃねえぞって思う」=“I'd think they're picking a fight with me.”
「怒りすぎだよね」=“You really do get mad way too easily, you know?”
「言い方だよ言い方。たとえばもっとこう、たとえば……たとえば？」=“It's in the way you say it. Like for example, you'd say it more, for example... for example?”
「あ、もう大丈夫です」=“Ah, it's fine, I got it.”
「ウムイの鐘って鳴らし方に決まりとかあるのかな？」=“You think there's a particular way that bell's gotta be rung? I mean the Bell of Umuy by the way.”
「どんな決まりだよ。鳴らす前におじぎ二回するとか、そういうのか？」=“What sorta way? Like bowing twice in front of it first or something?”
「ありそうじゃない？」=“Doesn't that sound likely?”
「あるかそんなもん。あったとして、誰が決めてんだよそんなルール」=“Like hell it does. Even if there was something like that, who the hell decided that?”
「体験談とか？　私達はこういう風にしました、みたいな」=“Probably just personal experience, no? Like, "We did it this way" and all.”
「口コミかよ。あ、あんなもん、他人どうこうじゃなくて自分なりでいいんだ」=“So literally just hearsay. T-That sorta stuff, should be done in your own way, not copying others willy nilly.”
「胸って男と女で感じ方にも差があるものなのかな？」=“You think there's a difference between even just how the pleasure from the nipples feels, between men and women?”
「そ、そんなこと私に聞かれても知らねぇよ」=“Y-You're not gonna get an answer for that from me, no way I'd know.”
「男は自分でいじったりとかしないんだけど、女の子はそうでもない？」=“I mean, men don't go out of their way to play with their nipples. Do women?”
「いじんねぇよ。虚しいだろそんなの」=“No way. Sounds so pathetic.”
「いじってもらう方が好きなんだ？」=“You prefer it when I do it to you then?”
「テメェ、私からどんな言質を引き出そうとしてやがる……」=“You, just what sort of words are you trying to drag outta my mouth...”
「フェチってどんなものがあるかな？　代表的なものだと……」=“What sort of fetishes are even out there? Like, if you could list one as a typical example, what would it...”
「なんか、あれだろ？　髪フェチとか脇フェチとかそういうの」=“I mean, there's stuff, no? Like hair fetish or armpit fetish or whatever.”
「俺は気が強くて男勝りで一匹狼なところがある女の子フェチかもしれない」=“Then I might have a fetish for strong willed, manly women with a lone wolf side to them.”
「それフェチじゃなくて好みだろ！　……って、ええ！？　お前っ」=“Isn't that just what you like, rather than a fetish?! ...Wuh, eeeh!? You--!”
「あははははは」=“Ahahahahahah.”
「からかいやがったな。わ、私はお前フェチじゃねぇから？　ぜってーちげぇから」=“You played me, didn't you? I-I don't have a fetish for you, alright? I definitely don't.”
（ウブで可愛いなー）=(She's so innocent, so adorable.)
「欲求不満って辛いよね」=“Sexual frustration is really rough, isn't it?”
「そ、それは、なんのアピールなんだよ？　まさか誘って……」=“W-Why're you, telling me that? Wait, are you asking for...”
「はー、辛いなー」=“Haah~, it's so bad~”
「こっち見んな！　欲求不満なんて、そ、そんなん、一人でこっそり……とか」=“Don't look at me! If you're feeling pent up then, g-go and like, deal with it by yourself... and stuff.”
「一人でこっそりしてるんだ」=“So you deal with it by yourself, huh?”
「お前の話だろ！　私は……ひ、一人でとか、しねぇよ……なんか怖いし」=“We're talking about you! I don't... r-really do it, by myself... it's kinda scary.”
「初めてした時のことなんだけど……」=“Back when we first did it...”
「な、なんだよ！　なんか文句あんのか。イマイチだったとか」=“W-What?! Got complaints? Like it was bad or whatever.”
「そんなわけないから！　身体大丈夫だったかなぁってだけ」=“No way! I was just wondering if you were fine afterwards and all.”
「私があんなもんでどうにかなるわけねぇだろ。思い出したりするくらいだ」=“No way in hell something like that would manage to do me in, idiot. I almost think back to it, sometimes.”
「思い出すって？」=“Think back to what?”
「だから、お、お前、意外とたくましいなとか……肌ってあったけぇんだな、とか」=“Like uh, y-you being, manlier than I expected or... your skin being warm and, whatnot.”
「い、言わせんじゃねぇよ！　お前のことちゃんと見られなくなっちまうだろ」=“D-Don't make me say it! I won't be able to look at your face anymore like this.”
「俺も思い出すよ。可愛かったなぁ、って」=“I think back to it too. Back to how adorable you were, I mean.”
「そっか……ふ、ふーん？　そらよかったな！　知らねぇけど」=“I see... H-Hmm? Glad to hear that! Not that I'd know.”
