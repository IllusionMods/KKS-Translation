「ホエールウォッチングって楽しそうだよね」=“Whale watching sounds like fun.”
「クジラ見んのか？　双眼鏡で」=“Whale watching?　With binoculars?”
「もうちょっと近くでかな。船の横とか泳いでるのが見られるらしいよ」=“Maybe closer than that. I heard you can see them swimming next boats, and stuff.”
「……近すぎんだろ。クジラって意外と警戒心ねぇんだな」=“...that's too close. Whales are a lot less cautious than you think.”
「まあ、どうにかされるとは思ってないんだろうね」=“Well, I guess they don't think they'll do anything about it.”
「調子乗ってんのか」=“You're on a roll.”
「クジラをそういう目で見る人、あんまりいないと思うよ」=“I don't think a lot of people look at whales that way.”
「ヤシガニは世界最大級の甲殻類なんだって」=“I heard coconut crabs are one of the largest crustaceans in the world.”
「てっぺんとってんのかよ。なかなかやるじゃねぇか」=“They're the top. That's pretty impressive.”
「で？　どんくらいでけぇんだよ」=“So?　How big are they?”
「平均で体長４０cmくらいだったかな？」=“About 40 centimeters long on average, right?”
「ンだよ、子犬くらいのもんじゃねぇか。ビビってんなよ」=“That's... that's like a puppy. I'm scared.”
「子犬くらいある甲殻類ってなかなかのものだよ……」=“A crustacean as big as a puppy would be quite something...”
「月桃ってキレイだよね」=“Shell ginger is beautiful.”
「なんだっけ？　……ああ、トイレの匂いみたいなのがする花か」=“What's that? ...ahh, the flower that smells like a toilet.”
「そういうことは思っても言わない方がいいと思う」=“You shouldn't say things like that, even when you thinking them.”
「私に乙女心みたいなのを求めてくんじゃねぇよ。やんのか」=“Don't ask me to be like some kind of maiden. You should know that.”
「わかった、ごめん。トイレの匂いでいいよ」=“Got it, sorry. So they smell like toilets.”
「……それはそれで、私らの力関係に花を巻き込むなよって思わなくもねぇな」=“...I just don't see the need to get flowers involved in the kind of relationship we have, though.”
「ヤマネコって強そうだよね」=“Wildcats appear to be strong.”
「ああ！　飼い慣らされた猫とは違う野性味ってもんをヤツからは感じるぜ」=“Ahhh!　Yeah! I sense this wildness in them that's different from that of domestic cats.”
「実際、野生の存在だしね」=“They are, in fact, wild.”
「イカすよな、あいつ。どっかにいねぇかな」=“They're cool dudes. I wonder if one's around somewhere.”
「猫好きなの？　へえ、ちょっと意外」=“You like cats?　Ehem, that's a little unexpected.”
「はああ？　好きとか言ってぇし。舐めてんなよ」=“Ahaaaa?　You said you liked them. Don't mess with me, man.”
「いや、さっき可愛いって自分で……」=“No, I just said they're cute...”
「お膝に乗せたいとか、ぜってぇ思ってねぇし」=“There's no way I want to put one on my lap.”
（お膝って言った……）=(She said 'lap'...)
「流星群ってロマンの塊だよね」=“Meteor showers are the stuff of romance.”
「私バカだから、ロマンとか言われてもあんまピンとこねぇけど……」=“I'm a little slow, so I don't know what you mean by 'romance'...”
「宇宙ってすげぇな、とかは感じなくもない」=“I can't help but feel that the universe is amazing.”
「それがロマンなんじゃないの？」=“Isn't that what romance is?”
「マジかよ。私、いつの間にかロマン掴んでたか」=“For real? And you grabbed the romance before you knew it.”
「掴むっていうか、まあ、はい」=“More like grasping, well, yeah.”
「……次はオーロラとかか」=“...next item, aurora borealis.”
「次の意味がよくわかりません」=“I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'next'.”
「サガリバナってどう思う？」=“What do you think of sagaribana?”
「一晩だけ咲く花とかだったか？　どうって聞かれてもなぁ……」=“That flower that blooms for one night?　Not sure what you're after...”
「頑張ってんなって感じか？　セミみてぇなもんだろ」=“You think it's trying it's best?　Like cicadas.”
「言いたいことはわかるけど、もうちょっとこう……なんだろ」=“I get what you're saying, but it's a little more... than that.”
「私にそういうの期待するなっての」=“Don't expect me to be like that.”
「実際に見たら、また印象も違うんじゃない？」=“I think you'd get a different impression if you saw it in person.”
「セミの羽化なら見たことあるぜ」=“I've seen cicadas hatch.”
「どう思ったの？」=“What did you think?”
「……セミだな、って思った」=“...I thought, 'That's a cicada.'”
（……サガリバナ見ても同じこと言いそう）=(...she'd say the same thing if she saw some sagaribana.)
「この前、鳥の巣の雛が孵ってたよ」=“I saw a bird's nest of chicks hatching the other day.”
「鳥？　ああ、そういやこの辺りは野鳥が多いんだってな」=“Birds?　Ahh, I heard there are a lot of wild birds around here.”
「ちっちゃくて可愛いよ」=“They're little cuties.”
「お、お前、可愛いとか……そういうの私には似合わねぇの知ってんだろ」=“Th-they're cute... you know that's not my style, man.”
「嫌いじゃないくせに。ちょっと見てみたいなぁ、とか思ってない？」=“But you don't hate it. Wouldn't you just like to take a little look?”
「思ってねぇよ」=“No, I wouldn't.”
「可愛いものが好きなら好きで、別におかしくないと思うけど」=“If you like cute things, you'll love them. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.”
「言ってねぇだろ誰もそんなことよォ！」=“I never said anything like that!”
「すごい怒る……」=“I'm so pissed...”
「そういえば、庭のアサガオがやっと咲いたんだ」=“Oh, by the way, the morning glory in my garden finally bloomed.”
「アサガオってお前……一人で観察日記でもつけてたのかよ」=“Your morning glories? So you've been keeping a journal all by yourself.”
「言われると思った。違うって、お世話してただけ」=“I knew you would say that. No, I'm just looking after them.”
「どうせ帰んのにそんなことしても、情が湧いちまうだけだろ」=“They're not gonna me home with you. They're gonna miss you so much.”
「そんな、野良犬とかじゃないんだから」=“It's not like they're a stray dog or anything.”
「まあ、でも、うん、お前そういう似合うな。なんか納得しちまった」=“Well, but, yeah, that suits you. I'm kinda convinced.”
「それはどういう意味での似合うなの？」=“What do you mean, that suits me?”
「マメっつーか、そんな感じ？　別にけなしたわけじゃねぇよ」=“Like, some wear and tear on you?　I didn't mean it as an insult.”
「ちょっと笑ってるけどね」=“You're kinda smiling, though.”
「マンタって水族館の人気物だよね」=“Manta rays are popular at the aquarium.?”
「マンタってあれだろ？　でっかいエイ……みたいな」=“That's what manta rays are, you know?　Like big stingrays...”
「そうそれ。ダイビングとかで潜ったら、けっこう会えるらしいよ」=“That's right. I hear you can see a bunch of them when you go diving.”
「……ダイビングねぇ」=“...diving, huh.”
「そっちに興味あるの？」=“Are you interested in that?”
「いや、そこまでしてエイを見たがるとか物好きなヤツが多いなと思っただけ」=“No, I'm just thinking there's a lot of people who want to see stingrays too much.”
「ドライすぎ」=“So dry.”
「海ほたるって知ってる？　波がピカピカ光る……」=“You ever heard of sea fireflies?　They make the waves shine...”
「ああ、あれだろ？　知ってるぜ」=“Ahh, what's that? I know of 'em.”
「すごいよね、あれ」=“They're amazing.”
「すごいかもしんねぇけど、ああいうのは誰かと実際に見てなんぼって気もするな」=“They might be amazing, but I think it'd be better to see them with someone.”
「いつにする？」=“When should we go?”
「そ、そういう意味で言ったんじゃねぇよ。調子乗ってんのか！」=“I-I didn't mean it like that. You're getting carried away!”
（照れ隠しが怖い……）=(She's hiding her embarrassment...)
「ウミガメって意外と泳ぐの上手だよね」=“Sea turtles are surprisingly good swimmers, aren't they?”
「知らねぇよ。てか、あいつらあんなんで泳げんのかよ」=“I don't know. I mean, how can they swim in that thing?”
「普通にスイスイ泳いでるよ」=“They can swim just fine.”
「どんくさそうなのにな。人は見かけによらない、ってことか」=“They look so awkward. I guess the way a person looks can be deceiving.”
（人ではないけど……）=(They're not people...)
「意外と力も強かったりしてな」=“Maybe they're stronger than they look.”
「さあ？　海藻が主食だから人を噛んだりはしないようなことを何かで見たけど」=“What?　I've read that they don't bite people because their main food is seaweed.”
「なんだ、泳ぐだけか」=“So you gonna swim with one?”
「他に何を期待したのかかがちょっと気になるね」=“I'm just curious what else you were expecting.”
「星の砂ってお土産としてはどうなのかな？」=“What do you think of star sand as a souvenir?”
「あの小瓶みたいなやつか？　私がもらったら……うーん、微妙か？」=“That little bottle thing?　If I were to get one from... mmm... subtle, much?”
「きみに似合うと思って、って言われたら？」=“What if he said he thought it would look good on you?”
「舐めてんじゃねえぞって思う」=“I'd be like, 'Don't mess with me.'”
「怒りすぎだよね」=“I think you're too angry.”
「言い方だよ言い方。たとえばもっとこう、たとえば……たとえば？」=“It's way you said it. More like this... for example, you know?”
「あ、もう大丈夫です」=“Ah, everything'll be fine.”
「ウムイの鐘って鳴らし方に決まりとかあるのかな？」=“I wonder if there are any rules about ringing the Umui Bell?”
「どんな決まりだよ。鳴らす前におじぎ二回するとか、そういうのか？」=“What kind of rules? Like bowing twice before ringing it, or something?”
「ありそうじゃない？」=“Isn't that likely?”
「あるかそんなもん。あったとして、誰が決めてんだよそんなルール」=“Who knows. And if there were, who decides on the rules?”
「体験談とか？　私達はこういう風にしました、みたいな」=“Legends and stuff?　Like, 'This is the way we did it'.”
「口コミかよ。あ、あんなもん、他人どうこうじゃなくて自分なりでいいんだ」=“Word of mouth. That kind of thing is not about other people, it's about being your own person.”
「胸って男と女で感じ方にも差があるものなのかな？」=“I wonder if breasts are something that men and women feel differently about?”
「そ、そんなこと私に聞かれても知らねぇよ」=“I-I don't know why you're asking me that.”
「男は自分でいじったりとかしないんだけど、女の子はそうでもない？」=“Guys don't play around with theirs, but girls do, don't they?”
「いじんねぇよ。虚しいだろそんなの」=“I want no part of this. It's just not worth it.”
「いじってもらう方が好きなんだ？」=“So you prefer when I do it?”
「テメェ、私からどんな言質を引き出そうとしてやがる……」=“What the hell statement are you trying to get out of me...?”
「フェチってどんなものがあるかな？　代表的なものだと……」=“What kind of fetishes are there? Like, some typical examples...”
「なんか、あれだろ？　髪フェチとか脇フェチとかそういうの」=“What's that, now? Like hair fetishes, armpit fetishes, etc.”
「俺は気が強くて男勝りで一匹狼なところがある女の子フェチかもしれない」=“I might have this fetish for girls who are strong, and masculine, and are lone wolves.”
「それフェチじゃなくて好みだろ！　……って、ええ！？　お前っ」=“That's not a fetish, that's a preference!　...wh--, ehh!? Me!?”
「あははははは」=“Ahahahaha!”
「からかいやがったな。わ、私はお前フェチじゃねぇから？　ぜってーちげぇから」=“You're making fun of me. I can't be your fetish, okay? You're crazy.”
（ウブで可愛いなー）=(Her naivette is so cute-)
「欲求不満って辛いよね」=“It's hard to be frustrated, isn't it?”
「そ、それは、なんのアピールなんだよ？　まさか誘って……」=“What kind of opening is that? Is that your way of inviting me...”
「はー、辛いなー」=“Ha- So touchy-”
「こっち見んな！　欲求不満なんて、そ、そんなん、一人でこっそり……とか」=“Don't look at me!　Wh-when you're frustrated, you... secretly, by myself... you know.”
「一人でこっそりしてるんだ」=“You sneak off by yourself.”
「お前の話だろ！　私は……ひ、一人でとか、しねぇよ……なんか怖いし」=“No, I'm talking about you!　I don't... do it by myself... ok, now I'm scared.”
「初めてした時のことなんだけど……」=“So, about the first time we did it...”
「な、なんだよ！　なんか文句あんのか。イマイチだったとか」=“Wh-what the hell!　You got a problem with me? You tellin' me it wasn't good?”
「そんなわけないから！　身体大丈夫だったかなぁってだけ」=“No, of course not!　I was just wondering if your body was okay.”
「私があんなもんでどうにかなるわけねぇだろ。思い出したりするくらいだ」=“I'm really not sure what you're getting at here. I even remember it.”
「思い出すって？」=“Remember what?”
「だから、お、お前、意外とたくましいなとか……肌ってあったけぇんだな、とか」=“So, like, oh, you're surprisingly strong, and... your skin is warm.”
「い、言わせんじゃねぇよ！　お前のことちゃんと見られなくなっちまうだろ」=“Don't make me say it!　I'll never be able to look at you properly.”
「俺も思い出すよ。可愛かったなぁ、って」=“I remember you too. I remember how cute you were.”
「そっか……ふ、ふーん？　そらよかったな！　知らねぇけど」=“I see... h-hhhm?　That's great!　I didn't know.”
