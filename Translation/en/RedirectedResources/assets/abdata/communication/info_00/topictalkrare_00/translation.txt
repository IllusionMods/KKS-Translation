「ねえ、ホエールウォッチングって知ってる？」=“Hey, you know what whale watching is?”
「ええ、もちろんよ。クジラって可愛いわよね♪　一度見てみたいわ」=“Yes, of course. Whales are really adorable, aren't they♪ I wanna see them once.”
「うん、俺も見てみたいよ。きっとデッカいんだろうなぁ……」=“Yep, me too. I bet they're huge...”
「ええ、大きいものを見ると、ドキドキしちゃうのよね♪」=“Yes, looking at big things really makes your heart pound, doesn't it♪”
「……クジラのこと、だよね？」=“...You're talking about whales, right?”
「そうよ？　だって、クジラの話をしてたじゃない」=“That's right. I mean, we were talking about whales, no?”
「別のなにかを想像しちゃったよ……」=“For some reason it made me imagine something different...”
「そういえば、ヤシガニって食べられるらしいね」=“Reminds me, seems like you can eat coconut crabs, huh?”
「そうなの？　あれって虫みたいなものでしょう？」=“Really? I mean, they're kinda like bugs, no?”
「でも食べられる虫もいるでしょ？」=“But there's bugs you can eat out there too, no?”
「……でも、食べない方がいいわ。だってあんなに可愛いんだもの」=“...Even if we can, we shouldn't. They're so darn adorable afterall.”
「……か、可愛いかなぁ？」=“...A-Are they?”
「ええ、見ているだけでキュン♪　ってしちゃうんだもの」=“Yes, just looking at them makes my heart flutter♪”
「そ、そうなんだ……まあ、食べないけどね」=“I-I see... well, not like I was gonna go and eat one, of course.”
「月桃って花、知ってる？」=“You know shell gingers? The flowers, I mean.”
「ええ、見たことあるわよ。ウットリしちゃうようないい匂いね」=“Yes, I've seen them before. They've got such an enchanting smell to them, don't they?”
「けっこう変わってると思うけどね。花の形もあんまり見たことないタイプだったなぁ」=“It's pretty weird though, all things considered. The flower's pretty unique too, I've never seen one like it before.”
「そう言われるとそうかも……名前的に桃の種類なのかしら？」=“Now that you say it, you're right... Going by the name, are they related to gingers?”
「桃には見えないね。むしろラッキョウみたい」=“If they are, they don't really look like them. If anything, they look more like onions.”
「……うーん、たしかに。食べたら美味しいのかしらね」=“...Nnn, you're not wrong. I wonder if they'd taste good?”
「ヤマネコ、好き？」=“You like wildcats?”
「もちろんよ。だってネコなんでしょ？　ふふ、お腹撫でてゴロゴロ言わせたいわ」=“Of course. I mean, they're cats, no? Fufuh, I wanna stroke its belly and scratch its ears.”
「野生のネコだから、そんなことしたら噛まれちゃうよ？」=“They're wild animals so, if you do that stuff, you're gonna get bitten, you know?”
「それは困るわね……お肌が傷ついちゃう」=“That would be problematic... that'd leave a mark on my skin.”
「傷付く程度で済めばいいけどね……」=“I mean, as long as it does just that...”
「はぁ……ヤマネコに会いたいわ。マタタビ持ってたら寄ってくるかしら？」=“Haah... I wanna see one. Do you think it'll come up to me if I have cat powder on me?”
「……うーん、どうだろう？　そんなチョロい生き物じゃないような気がする」=“...Nnn, I dunno? I feel like they're not that gullible as far as animals go.”
「そう……それは残念ねぇ……はぁ、ネコちゃん……飼ってみたいわ」=“I see... that's a shame... haah, I want... a cat so bad.”
「……ヤマネコじゃなく、イエネコになっちゃうね」=“...You'd want a housecat then, rather than a wildcat.”
「流れ星って、綺麗だよね……」=“Shooting stars are really beautiful, aren't they...”
「ええ、神秘的過ぎて、見ているだけでドキドキしちゃう♪」=“Yes, they're so mystical, just looking at them makes my heart pound♪”
「光の筋がすーっと夜空に伸びていく光景……最高だわ」=“The sight of that light tail stretching out over the entire sky... it's just the best.”
「……でも、絶対願い事をいう暇ないよね、あれ」=“...But, they really don't give you much time to make a wish, do they?”
「……無いわね。だって一瞬で消えちゃうんだもの」=“...Nope, none at all. They really do go by in less than a second.”
「早口言葉を普段から練習しておかないとね」=“Just gonna have to practice our tongue twister skills, huh?”
「ふふ……その考え方、可愛い♪　しっかりお願いできればいいわね」=“Fufuh... that's such an adorable way of thinking about it♪ I hope you can get your wishes out fast enough.”
「サガリバナって知ってる？」=“You know about Mango Pines?”
「ええ。一夜に咲いてして散っちゃう、幻の花よね」=“Yes. They're dreamy flowers that bloom for just one night and then die, right?”
「夜に咲くけど、実際の見どころは散る間際の明け方らしいよ」=“They do bloom at night, but apparently the best time to see them is when they're just about to wilt, almost at dawn.”
「じゃあ、本気で楽しもうとしたら徹夜しなくちゃ」=“Then, if we wanna appreciate them properly we're gonna have to stay up all night, won't we?”
「だね。実際咲くかどうかも分からないし、正に幻の花だよね」=“Yep. And you don't know if it's gonna actually bloom in the first place, so it truly is a dreamy flower.”
「君と一緒に見ることが出来たら、素敵でしょうね♪」=“I bet it'd make for a wonderful night, if we could look at them together♪”
「鳥の巣を見守ってたんだけど、雛が孵ってたんだ。あれはなかなか感動だったよ」=“I've been watching over this birds' nest for a bit, and the egg in it finally hatched. It was a pretty moving sight.”
「へえ、すごいわね！　可愛かった？」=“Heh, that's amazing! Was it cute?”
「うん、見ていて感慨深いものがあったよ」=“Yep, it made me very emotional.”
「ふふふ、なんだか君、お父さんみたいな顔になってるわよ」=“Fufufuh, you're looking very fatherly right now, you know?”
「……ホントに？」=“...Really?”
「ひな鳥ちゃんも、君をお父さんって思ってるかも……」=“Maybe the little chick thinks of you as its daddy too...”
「……鳥って、生まれた直後に見たものを親に思うらしいからね」=“...They do think of anything they lay their sight on first after hatching as their parent, afterall, don't they?”
「引き取って、育ててあげられればいいのにね」=“You could just pick it up, and raise it as your own.”
「うん……ちょっと情がわいちゃった。でも自然の中が一番だから」=“Yeah... a part of me does want to, for sure. But leaving it be within nature would be the best choice.”
「ふふ、迷いを吹っ切る表情……すごく素敵だわ。ゾクゾクしちゃう♪」=“Fufuh, that serious and hardened expression... it's lovely. It's making my heart pound♪”
「……あはは、慰めてくれてるんだね。ありがとう」=“...Ahahah, you're trying to console me, aren't you? Thanks.”
「ずっと水をあげてたアサガオが、やっと咲いたんだ」=“This morning glory I've been watering for ages, finally blossomed.”
「あら、頑張ったわね！　えらいえらい♪」=“Oh my, must have been really bothersome work! I'm proud of you♪”
「うん、結構大変だったんだよ……」=“Yep, it was pretty annoying to do it everyday, for sure...”
「子供の頃、観察日記をつけてたけど、別に大変じゃなかったわよね」=“We had to make plant observation diaries as kids but, it wasn't that annoying back then, was it?”
「大変じゃなかったよね……子供の頃には早起きとか全然平気だったのに」=“Not at all... getting up early as kids was so much easier too.”
「大人になるって、こういうことなのかもしれないわね……」=“This might just be, what growing up into adults means...”
「……アサガオで人生を語るのも、なんだか変な話だけどね」=“...Talking about life over some morning glories is, pretty weird stuff though.”
「マンタって不思議な見た目をしてるよね」=“Mantas have this really strange look to them, don't they?”
「そうね、どうしてあんな形になっちゃったのかしら」=“Yeah, I wonder why they took that shape?”
「まあ、エイの仲間だしね」=“Well, they are in the same family as rays, so.”
「でも、エイを見ても『エイだな～』しか思わないじゃない？」=“But, even looking at rays doesn't make you think more than "That's a ray alright~", no?”
「マンタは『すご～い……立派～』ってなっちゃうのよね～」=“Whereas mantas make you go "Amazing~... so handsome~", you know~?”
「その言い方……まあ別にいいんだけどね」=“That's... well, I guess it's fine.”
「海ほたるって綺麗だよね」=“Sea fireflies are really pretty, aren't they?”
「幻想的よね。夢の世界に迷い込んだみたいな気持ちになっちゃう」=“They make for a fantastical sight, don't they? Makes me feel like I've lost my way in some sort of dream world.”
「うん、不思議な輝きだよね……でも、昆虫の蛍じゃないんだよね、あれ」=“Yep, it's just something else, isn't it... but, they're not actual bugs like fireflies, are they?”
「ええ、そうみたいね。図鑑で見たことあるけど……可愛かった～♪」=“Yeah, seems like it. I've seen them in picture books before... so adorable~♪”
「……え？　か、可愛い……？　変な平べったい、謎の生き物だったけど」=“...Eh? A-Adorable...? Looked more like a weirdly flat, mysterious sorta species to me.”
「もう……お子様なのね。あの可愛さがわからないだなんて……」=“Jeez... you're such a kid. I can't believe you can't see their cuteness...”
「……うん、ちっともわからないや」=“...Nope, I don't see it one bit.”
「そういえば、このあたりにはよくウミガメが卵を産みにくるんだって」=“Reminds me, apparently sea turtles come around these parts often, to lay eggs.”
「ウミガメの産卵……。あれって、美しいけど、自然の残酷さを感じるわ」=“Sea turtles laying eggs... It's a beautiful sight but, it makes me feel the mercilessness of nature too.”
「生まれた子ガメは、ほとんど産みにたどり着けなくて死んじゃうんだよね」=“The newborn babies almost never make it to sea and die prematurely, don't they?”
「ええ……母亀の方も、必死になって砂浜にやって来なきゃ駄目なの……」=“Yes... and the mother too, she has to come all the way to the shore herself...”
「水中と違って、動きが鈍いから大変なんでしょうね……」=“It's probably an incredibly difficult journey, considering they're not really evolved to walk on land...”
「……でも、それなら、水中で産めばいいんじゃない？」=“...But, why not just lay the eggs in water then?”
「それは……そうね。今後進化したらそうなるのかしら……」=“That's... yeah. That's probably how they'll evolve next, I imagine...”
「数億年ぐらいかければ、そうなるかもしれないね」=“They just might, in a few hundred million years.”
「お土産コーナーで、星の砂が売られていたよ」=“I saw them selling star sand, at the souvenir corner.”
「ああ、あのトゲトゲした砂粒が詰まった、可愛い小瓶でしょ？」=“Aah, you mean those tiny little bottles with those spikey bits of sand, right?”
「いいわよね、小さな小瓶って。インテリアにピッタリだわ」=“Those bottles are so nice, aren't they? They fit the sand perfectly.”
「……星の砂じゃなく、小瓶への評価がメインだね」=“...I see that the bottles are the main attraction to you, rather than the sand.”
「あら、もちろん砂も可愛いわよ。瓶の可愛さには勝てないけど」=“Dearie, of course I think the sand's really cute too. Not as cute as the bottles it comes in though.”
「う～ん……小瓶に可愛さを感じたことないなぁ」=“Nnn~... can't say I've ever felt their cuteness, myself.”
「『恋人の鐘』ってさ、ちょっとお手軽過ぎない？」=“Doesn't the Bell of Umuy feel a bit too easy? Like to the point of being cheap?”
「お手軽なのがいいんじゃない。男女の仲なんて、不安定なのが当たり前なんだもの」=“And what's wrong with that? The relationship between a man and woman's unstable to begin with.”
「不安定か……確かに、機嫌が悪いときもあれば、意見が違って衝突することもあるよね」=“Unstable, huh... for sure. It's easy to get in fights over a difference in opinion when one of the two is in a bad mood, isn't it?”
「でも多少ケンカしないと、仲直りの仕方がわからないままになっちゃうわよ」=“But if people don't get into those fights, they won't ever learn how to make up with each other either.”
「……そういう考え方もあるんだね」=“...I guess that's one way of thinking about it, yeah.”
「いつまでもラブラブでいるためには、必要なことね」=“It's very important, for staying in love forever.”
「そうだね、そうかも……」=“Yeah, you're not wrong...”
「はぁ……どうしても女性の胸に目が行ってしまうんだよね」=“Haah... I just can't help my eyes from looking at girls' chests sometimes, you know?”
「それは男の子だから仕方ないんじゃない？」=“I mean, you're a boy, you can't really help it, no?”
「そう言ってもらえると安心するよ」=“I'm really glad you're so understanding of it.”
「でもあんまりジロジロ見るのは駄目よ？　怖がらせちゃうから」=“But you can't use that as an excuse to stare, okay? Girls scare very easily.”
「……チラ見ならOK？」=“...But a glance is okay?”
「まあ、チラ見ぐらいならね」=“I guess, as long as it goes no further.”
「フェチズムってどう思う？」=“What do you think of fetishm?”
「フェチシズムじゃないの？」=“Isn't it <color%3Dpurple>fetishism<color>?”
「……フェチシズム？　そうなの？」=“...Really?”
「そうだったと思うけど……ちょっと自信ないわね。英語は得意じゃないし……」=“I thought so but... now I'm not sure. Not like my English's super good...”
「……って、そういうことじゃなくって、性的嗜好の話がしたいんだけど」=“...--, that doesn't matter either way, what I wanted to ask was about your sexual preferences.”
「長くなるわよ？　私、そういう話大好きだから」=“We're gonna be here a while if so, you know? I love talking about that sorta stuff.”
「そ、そうなんだ……うん、じゃあ、またいずれ時間があるときに……」=“I-I see... okay, then, when we have more time together...”
「女性でも欲求不満を感じることがあるんだってね」=“Apparently girls feel sexually frustrated too, huh?”
「あるわよ。当然じゃないの」=“We do. Isn't that obvious?”
「そういう時って、どうするの？」=“What do you do, when you do?”
「あら、そんなこと聞いてどうするのかしら？」=“Oh my, what are you going to do with that information?”
「い、いや、別に……ただ、その……ちょっと知りたかっただけだよ」=“N-Nothing, in particular... I just, uhm... wanted to know, that's all.”
「ふふ、知らない方がいいよ思うわよ。軽蔑されちゃうかも」=“Fufuh, you're better off not knowing, honestly. You might get disgusted away.”
（それはそれで興味あるけどね……）=(I dunno, that sounds interesting in its own right...)
「……俺との初めてのこと、憶えてる？」=“...Do you remember, about the first time we did it?”
「忘れるわけないでしょう？　きっと永久に忘れないわね……ふふふ」=“Do you really think I could forget? I probably won't forget it, ever... fufufuh~”
「そんなに……？　それはいい意味で？」=“That strongly...? Is it a good memory for you?”
「ええ、いい意味で。でも、もしケンカとかしたら……途端に逆転しちゃうわよ？」=“Yes, of course. But if we ever have a big fight... it's gonna turn into a bad memory real fast, you know?”
「……機嫌を損ねないよう、気をつけるよ」=“...I'll be careful not to make you mad then.”
「そうした方がいいわね。もちろん……私もケンカにならないよう注意するわ」=“Good, do that. Of course... I'll be careful not to make you mad either, ever.”
「うん……お互い、仲良しが一番だよね」=“Yeah... Best to get along happily.”
