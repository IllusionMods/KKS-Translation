「ホエールウォッチングって興味ある？」=“Got any interest in whale watching?”
「ああ、あれはいいものだ」=“Yeah, that's a good one.”
「なにしろ迫力が段違いだし、見てて飽きないからな」=“It's got a ton of impact, and you'd never get bored of looking at a whale either.”
「[H名]って大きな生き物とか好きそうだよね」=“You do seem like the type of girl to like big creatures, afterall.”
「は？　なんだそれは？　まぁ、嫌いではないが……」=“Hah? What's that supposed to mean? I mean, I don't hate them I guess...”
（……やっぱり。わりと感性が男の子っぽいところがあるからなぁ）=(...I knew it. She does have her boyish sides, doesn't she~?)
「ヤシガニの巣って掘った穴タイプが多いのかな？」=“Do coconut crabs usually tend to dig out holes in the ground to make nests?”
「そんなこと私が知るわけないだろ。そもそも他に種類があるのか？」=“Do you really think I'd know the answer to that? To begin with, do they make nests any other way?”
「岩の隙間とかに巣を作るとは聞いたことはあるよ」=“I've heard of it before, coconut crabs making their nests between some rocks and whathaveyou.”
「でも、ヤシガニって大きいと足も含めて１メートルを超えるみたいなんだよね……」=“But, sometimes they can get as big as one meter if you include the legs, you know?...”
「そいつはずいぶんとデカいな……」=“That's pretty big...”
「そんな奴が隙間に隠れたら、挟まって身動き出来ないんじゃないか？」=“If such a big guy tried fitting between rocks, wouldn't it just get stuck?”
「だよね。ということは、穴のタイプが多いのかもしれないね」=“Yeah, makes sense. So maybe they do usually dig out holes.”
「月桃って花、あれって生姜の仲間らしいね」=“Seems like shell gingers are actually a part of the ginger family.”
「なに、そうなのか？」=“Huh, really?”
「いや、香りも強いし、あながち間違いじゃないのか……？」=“No, I guess their aroma's pretty strong too, so it might actually be true...?”
「調べて見たら、香辛料としても使われてるみたい」=“I looked into it, and apparently they're used as a spice too.”
「想像以上に多目的に利用できる優秀な植物なんだな」=“That's one amazing plant, you really can use it for everything.”
「月桃、侮れないね……」=“Yep, you can't look down on them...”
「ヤマネコって可愛いよね」=“Wildcats are cute, aren't they?”
「この島にいる野性のネコだったか？　確かに愛らしい姿をしていたな」=“You mean those cats running around this island, huh? They're definitely pretty darn adorable.”
「しかし普通のネコとヤマネコは一体なにが違うんだ？」=“But what's exactly the difference between a housecat and a wildcat anyway?”
「見た目は……まぁ微妙に違うが、可愛いことに変わりはないぞ」=“I mean, they look... mostly the same but, both are just as cute.”
「……そういうことを調べるのが、この旅行の目的だと思うよ！」=“...I think finding that sort of stuff out is what this trip is all about!”
「つまり知らないってことだな。だが、おまえが言うことは正しい。今度ふたりで調べてみるか？」=“So basically you don't know, huh? But what you're saying is definitely true. Wanna look into it together?”
「[H名]は流れ星を見たらどうする？」=“If you saw any shooting stars, what would you do, [H名]?”
「特になにもしないぞ」=“Nothing in particular.”
「そうなんだ？　女の子って願いごととかするのかなって思ったんだけど」=“Really? I was thinking that maybe a girl would try to make a wish or something.”
「願いごとといっても、結局は神頼みみたいなものだろ？」=“I mean, even if you do that, you're basically just asking a god for help there, no?”
「それをすると、なんか負けたような気がするんだよ」=“If I did that, I'd feel like I've lost in some way.”
「じゃあ、特に願いごとはないんだ……」=“So you don't have anything to wish for, huh...”
「仮にあったとしても、私は自分の手で勝ち取るさ」=“Even if I did, I'd make it come true with my own hands.”
「一夜で散るっていうサガリバナって知ってる？」=“Do you know about mango pines? Those flowers that only bloom for a single night, I mean.”
「なかなか咲いてるところを見られない珍しい花だろ？」=“You mean those flowers that you never can manage to catch blooming, right?”
「ああいうのには、あまり縁がなくてな……」=“I just don't have any luck with that sorta thing, you know...”
「[H名]もやっぱり花は好きなんだ？」=“You like flowers too then, [H名]?”
「まぁ、私だって女だしな」=“Well, I'm a girl too.”
「……って、なんだ、その顔。私が花好きで悪いのか？」=“...What's with that face? What, should I not like them?”
「な、なにも言ってないって！　でも、そんな[H名]は可愛いと思うよ」=“I-I didn't say anything! But I do think that's pretty adorable.”
「ふんっ……調子のいいことを言うな」=“Hmph--... always with that stuff.”
「そうそう。そういえば、しばらく見守ってた鳥の雛が孵ったんだ」=“Oh right, reminds me. This bird egg I've been watching over finally hatched a little birdie.”
「ふぅん。その雛は可愛いのか？」=“Hmm. Is it cute?”
「もちろん、よしよし撫でたいくらいにね。まぁ、さすがにしてないけどさ」=“Of course, I almost wanted to stroke its tiny head. Though, I didn't go that far.”
「それは正しい判断だな。人のにおいが付着すると、親鳥が世話をしなくなるらしいからな」=“That was the right choice on your part. Apparently their parents stop caring for them, if they get the smell of a human on them.”
「それにしても、どうしてそんなことをしていたんだ？」=“Still, why were you watching over it?”
「気が付いたらなんか放っておけなくてさ」=“I just couldn't let it be once I found it.”
「人が近くにいたら卵の天敵も簡単には寄ってこないかなーとか思って見てたんだ」=“I also thought that their natural predators would stay away, if a human was nearby.”
「なるほどな。フフ、優しいじゃないか。私が頭を撫でようか？」=“I see. Fufuh, well, aren't you sweet? Want me to stroke your head?”
「そ、それは魅力的だけど、ちょっと恥ずかしいかな」=“T-That sounds very appealing, but also a bit embarrassing.”
「せっせと水をあげてたアサガオが咲いたんだよ」=“This morning glory I've been diligently watering daily finally bloomed.”
「素朴だけど、アサガオの花って綺麗だよね」=“They're very simple flowers, but very pretty too, aren't they?”
「そうだな。まぁ、最近は都会じゃあまり見かけないけど」=“Yeah. Then again, you don't really see them in the city anymore.”
「あれって、子供の自由研究以外だと滅多に見かけないよな？」=“You don't really see those outside of kids' summer vacation homework projects, do you?”
「そういわれると、確かにあまり見かけないかも……」=“Now that you say it, you might be right...”
「……なんだか急にノスタルジックな気持ちになってきたな」=“...Suddenly it's started feeling a lot more nostalgic.”
「私も童心に帰って、アサガオを育ててみるかな」=“Maybe I'll go back to being a kid for a bit too, and grow one myself.”
「お、仲間が増えるのは大歓迎だよ」=“Oh, that'd be great, we could grow them together.”
「マンタって、良く見れば不思議な生き物だよね」=“Mantas are very incredible creatures when you think about it, aren't they?”
「平べったいところとかか？」=“You mean how they're so flat?”
「それもそうだけど、あれってかなり大きいでしょ？」=“There's that too but, they're like pretty darn big, no?”
「海の生き物って不思議だなぁって、つくづく思うよ」=“I just can't help but think how incredible sea creatures are.”
「それ、海の生き物からみた陸の生き物も同じじゃないのか？」=“Wouldn't that be the same for us, from their viewpoint?”
「生息している環境が全然違うわけだしな」=“The environments we live in are completely different, afterall.”
「海ほたるをみて思ったんだ。あれって漁り火に似てないかな？」=“I was looking at sea fireflies when it hit me. Don't they look pretty similar to fishing lights?”
「……そうか？　言うほど似てないと思うが」=“...You think? I don't think they look that similar.”
「でも、海上と海面で違いがあるけど、どっちも明るいでしょ？」=“I mean yeah, there is the difference of one being inside the water and the other being above it but, both are pretty bright, no?”
「あの光に釣られて魚やイカが集まって来たりしないのかな？」=“Wouldn't the light from them end up attracting fish or squids and whatnot?”
「そう言われると、集まって来そうな気もするな……」=“Now that you say it, I feel like they might...”
「今度、潜って調べて見るのもいいかもしれないな」=“It might be nice to go diving and check it out for ourselves, sometime.”
「この前、ウミガメを見かけたよ」=“The other day, I saw a sea turtle.”
「へぇ、珍しいものを見たんだな」=“Hoh, that's a pretty rare thing.”
「上に乗ったりはしなかったのか？　乗れば浦島太郎気分になれたかもな」=“Did you try getting on top of one? You could have pretended you over Urashima Tarou for a bit.”
「さすがに触ったりはしてないよ。そもそも乗るのは絶対ダメだし」=“Nah, even I'm not that far gone, I didn't even touch it. To begin with, I'm pretty sure you'd kill it that way.”
「でも、竜宮城には行ってみたいなぁ……」=“Though, it'd be so nice to go visit the dragon king's palace...”
「フッ、いじめっ子たちを倒すのは私に任せろ」=“Pff--, leave beating up the bullies to me.”
「だから財宝を持ち帰ったら、分け前は半分だぞ」=“So when you come back, split the treasure with me 50-50.”
「海岸の一帯が星の砂になってるのって、すごい見応えがありそうだよね」=“It'd be a real spectacle to see a whole stretch of the beach turned into starsand, wouldn't it?”
「そのかわり、裸足で歩くとめちゃくちゃ痛いんじゃないか？」=“Wouldn't that make walking barefoot on it hurt like hell though?”
「ああ、確かに……なんか修行とかでありそうなシチュエーションだよね」=“Aah, you're not wrong... seems like the sort of thing you'd do when doing some sort of training, doesn't it?”
「多分、俺はまともに歩けないんだろうなぁ」=“I probably wouldn't be able to walk properly at all~”
「なんだ、情けない。男ならもっと気合いを入れろ」=“What? So pathetic. You're a man, get some fire in you.”
「よし、お土産の星の砂を買って練習だな」=“Alright, guess it's time we buy some starsand and get some practice in.”
「いやいや、わざわざそれをするのはもったいないって」=“No way, that'd be such an incredible waste.”
「ウムイの鐘の音色がボクシングのゴングみたいだったらどうする？」=“What if the chime of the bell of Umuy actually sounded like a boxing gong?”
「質問の意味も意図も分からん……」=“I don't get either the what or the why of that question...”
「一緒に鳴らそうとした相手とのバトルが始まるってことなのか？」=“So you're saying that it'd signify the start of a battle between the pair that rings that bell together?”
「うーん……そうなるのかな？」=“Nnn... maybe? You think?”
「だとしたら、先手必勝だな。やられる前にやる」=“If so, then victory goes to the one who makes the first move. Do them in, before they do you in.”
「結ばれるのは普通の縁じゃなくて、因縁の方だったってオチだね」=“I guess it'd make it less about fate and more about karma, huh?”
「赤ん坊って、どれくらいの大きさのおっぱいが好きなんだろ？」=“I wonder how big a bust size do babies prefer?”
「やっぱり母乳の飲みやすさとかに差があるのかな？」=“Like, do you think the size makes a difference in whether it's easier to drink or not?”
「……私が知ってるわけないだろ」=“...How would I know?”
「自分で飲んでみて調べたらどうだ？」=“Why don't you just try and see for yourself?”
「えっ、[H名]がおっぱいを飲ませてくれるの！？」=“Eh--, you'll let me?!”
「だ、誰もそんなことは言ってない！」=“W-Who said that, I didn't!”
「フェチズムってかなり深いと思うんだ」=“I think kinks and fetishes are very deep things.”
「[H名]には何かフェチ的なこだわりとかないの？」=“Do you have any fetishes or kinks yourself, [H名]?”
「フェチかどうかはともかく、相手を攻めるのは割りと好きだな」=“I don't know whether it counts as one of those but, I like being on the assaulting side a lot more.”
「えっ……けっこうＳなの？」=“Eh--... are you like an S?”
「そこまで極端じゃない」=“I'm not that extreme.”
「ただ、相手が反応する姿にそそられるだけだ」=“It just really excites me when I can see your reactions.”
（……それはＳに該当すると思うんだけどなぁ）=(...I'm pretty sure that counts as S.)
「欲求不満になったときってどんなことしてる？」=“What do you do when you feel sexually frustrated?”
「やっぱり一人で慰めたりとかするのかな」=“I'm guessing you sort it out by yourself?”
「ま、まぁ、そういうときもある……」=“W-Well, sometimes but well...”
「……おまえの方はどうなんだ？」=“...What about you? What do you do?”
「え？　俺のひとりエッチに興味あるの？　いっぱい聞かせてあげてもいいよ」=“Eh? You're interested in my masturbation sessions? I'll tell you whatever you wanna know, so fire away.”
「いや、いい！　聞いた私が悪かった！」=“No, I'm good! Sorry, it was my fault for asking!”
「初めてのエッチのときって、やっぱり辛かったのかな？」=“Was it rough on you, when we did it the first time around?”
「まぁ……膜が破れるときは、さすがに痛みが響いたな」=“Well... It did hurt when you tore my hymen, for sure.”
「堪えていると次第によくなって――」=“But I endured it, and as we went along, it started feeling better--”
「って、変なこと言わせるな！　変態っ」=“Wuh, don't make me say weird stuff! You pervert--!”
「ははっ、ごめんごめん」=“Hahah--, sorry, sorry.”
「でも、さすが[H名]って感じだね」=“But, that's just like you, [H名].”
「わ、私のことはもういいっ。おまえはどうなんだ？」=“E-Enough about me--! What about you?”
「人に言わせておいて自分はだんまりなんて許さないぞ」=“I'm not gonna tolerate this one sided information extraction, you know.”
「うわっ、やぶ蛇だった……！」=“Uwah--, I shot myself in the foot...!”
