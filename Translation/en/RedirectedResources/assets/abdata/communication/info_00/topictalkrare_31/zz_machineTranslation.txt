「ホエールウォッチングって興味ある？」=“Are you interested in whale watching?”
「ああ、あれはいいものだ」=“Oh, that's a good one.”
「なにしろ迫力が段違いだし、見てて飽きないからな」=“It's so much more powerful. I can't get enough of it.”
「[H名]って大きな生き物とか好きそうだよね」=“[H名] seems to like big creatures and stuff.”
「は？　なんだそれは？　まぁ、嫌いではないが……」=“What?　What's that?　Well, it's not that I don't like them. ......”
（……やっぱり。わりと感性が男の子っぽいところがあるからなぁ）=(...... I knew it. He's got a rather boyish sensibility.
「ヤシガニの巣って掘った穴タイプが多いのかな？」=“I wonder if most coconut crab nests are the dug-hole type.”
「そんなこと私が知るわけないだろ。そもそも他に種類があるのか？」=“I can't possibly know that. Are there any other types in the first place?”
「岩の隙間とかに巣を作るとは聞いたことはあるよ」=“I've heard of them nesting in crevices in rocks.”
「でも、ヤシガニって大きいと足も含めて１メートルを超えるみたいなんだよね……」=“But coconut crabs can grow over a meter, including their legs. ......”
「そいつはずいぶんとデカいな……」=“That's a pretty big one. ......”
「そんな奴が隙間に隠れたら、挟まって身動き出来ないんじゃないか？」=“If a guy like that hid in a crevice, wouldn't he get stuck?”
「だよね。ということは、穴のタイプが多いのかもしれないね」=“That's right. So maybe it's more of a hole type.”
「月桃って花、あれって生姜の仲間らしいね」=“Gingko, the flower, it's a member of the ginger family.”
「なに、そうなのか？」=“What, is that so?”
「いや、香りも強いし、あながち間違いじゃないのか……？」=“No, it has a strong scent. Isn't that right, ......?”
「調べて見たら、香辛料としても使われてるみたい」=“I looked it up. It's also used as a spice.”
「想像以上に多目的に利用できる優秀な植物なんだな」=“It's an excellent plant that can be used for more purposes than I thought.”
「月桃、侮れないね……」=“Moonberries are not to be underestimated. ......”
「ヤマネコって可愛いよね」=“Isn't the bobcat cute?”
「この島にいる野性のネコだったか？　確かに愛らしい姿をしていたな」=“Was it a wild cat on the island?　They sure do have a lovely appearance.”
「しかし普通のネコとヤマネコは一体なにが違うんだ？」=“But what's the difference between a normal cat and a bobcat?”
「見た目は……まぁ微妙に違うが、可愛いことに変わりはないぞ」=“They may look ...... slightly different, but they're still cute.”
「……そういうことを調べるのが、この旅行の目的だと思うよ！」=“...... I think that's the purpose of this trip, to find out!”
「つまり知らないってことだな。だが、おまえが言うことは正しい。今度ふたりで調べてみるか？」=“So you don't know. But you're right. Maybe you and I should check it out sometime.”
「[H名]は流れ星を見たらどうする？」=“What would [H名] do if she saw a shooting star?”
「特になにもしないぞ」=“I don't do anything.”
「そうなんだ？　女の子って願いごととかするのかなって思ったんだけど」=“Oh, really?　I was just wondering if girls make wishes.”
「願いごとといっても、結局は神頼みみたいなものだろ？」=“I thought girls made wishes, but I guess it's like asking God.”
「それをすると、なんか負けたような気がするんだよ」=“I feel like a loser when I do that.”
「じゃあ、特に願いごとはないんだ……」=“So you don't have a wish. ......”
「仮にあったとしても、私は自分の手で勝ち取るさ」=“Even if I did, I'd get it myself.”
「一夜で散るっていうサガリバナって知ってる？」=“Have you ever heard of the sagebrush that falls in one night?”
「なかなか咲いてるところを見られない珍しい花だろ？」=“It's a rare flower that you don't see blooming very often.”
「ああいうのには、あまり縁がなくてな……」=“I've never had much luck with that kind of thing. ......”
「[H名]もやっぱり花は好きなんだ？」=“Does [H名] like flowers after all?”
「まぁ、私だって女だしな」=“Well, I'm a woman.”
「……って、なんだ、その顔。私が花好きで悪いのか？」=“What's with the ...... face? What's wrong with me being a flower lover?”
「な、なにも言ってないって！　でも、そんな[H名]は可愛いと思うよ」=“I didn't say anything!　But I think [H名] is cute like that.”
「ふんっ……調子のいいことを言うな」=“But I think [H名] is cute like that.”
「そうそう。そういえば、しばらく見守ってた鳥の雛が孵ったんだ」=“Yeah, yeah. Oh, by the way, the bird I've been watching over for a while has hatched chicks.”
「ふぅん。その雛は可愛いのか？」=“Hmmm. Are the chicks cute?”
「もちろん、よしよし撫でたいくらいにね。まぁ、さすがにしてないけどさ」=“Of course, I want to pet them so badly. Well, I didn't.”
「それは正しい判断だな。人のにおいが付着すると、親鳥が世話をしなくなるらしいからな」=“That's a good call. I've heard that the parent birds stop taking care of the chicks when they get human scent on them.”
「それにしても、どうしてそんなことをしていたんだ？」=“So why did you do it, anyway?”
「気が付いたらなんか放っておけなくてさ」=“When I found out, I couldn't leave it alone.”
「人が近くにいたら卵の天敵も簡単には寄ってこないかなーとか思って見てたんだ」=“I figured if I was around, the natural enemies of the eggs wouldn't be so easily attracted.”
「なるほどな。フフ、優しいじゃないか。私が頭を撫でようか？」=“I see. That's very kind of you. Would you like me to pet your head?”
「そ、それは魅力的だけど、ちょっと恥ずかしいかな」=“Well, that's tempting, but I'm a little embarrassed.”
「せっせと水をあげてたアサガオが咲いたんだよ」=“I've been watering the morning glory and it's blooming.”
「素朴だけど、アサガオの花って綺麗だよね」=“I know it sounds naive, but aren't morning glories beautiful?”
「そうだな。まぁ、最近は都会じゃあまり見かけないけど」=“Yes, they are. Well, you don't see many of them in the city these days.”
「あれって、子供の自由研究以外だと滅多に見かけないよな？」=“You don't see many of them except in children's free studies, do you?”
「そういわれると、確かにあまり見かけないかも……」=“You're right, you don't see many of them. ......”
「……なんだか急にノスタルジックな気持ちになってきたな」=“...... I'm suddenly feeling nostalgic.”
「私も童心に帰って、アサガオを育ててみるかな」=“I think I'll go back to my childhood and try growing morning glories.”
「お、仲間が増えるのは大歓迎だよ」=“Oh, I'm always happy to have more friends.”
「マンタって、良く見れば不思議な生き物だよね」=“Manta rays are strange creatures, aren't they?”
「平べったいところとかか？」=“Like their flatness?”
「それもそうだけど、あれってかなり大きいでしょ？」=“Yeah, but they're pretty big, too, aren't they?”
「海の生き物って不思議だなぁって、つくづく思うよ」=“You know, I've always wondered about sea creatures.”
「それ、海の生き物からみた陸の生き物も同じじゃないのか？」=“Isn't that the same for land creatures as for sea creatures?”
「生息している環境が全然違うわけだしな」=“They live in completely different environments.”
「海ほたるをみて思ったんだ。あれって漁り火に似てないかな？」=“When I saw the sea fireflies, I thought. When I saw the sea fireflies, I thought, don't they look like fishing fires?”
「……そうか？　言うほど似てないと思うが」=“...... Is that so?　I don't think it's as similar as you think.”
「でも、海上と海面で違いがあるけど、どっちも明るいでしょ？」=“But there's a difference between the sea and the surface, but they're both bright, right?”
「あの光に釣られて魚やイカが集まって来たりしないのかな？」=“Doesn't that light attract fish and squid?”
「そう言われると、集まって来そうな気もするな……」=“Now that you mention it, I think they might. ......”
「今度、潜って調べて見るのもいいかもしれないな」=“Maybe I should dive down and check it out.”
「この前、ウミガメを見かけたよ」=“I saw a sea turtle the other day.”
「へぇ、珍しいものを見たんだな」=“Wow, you must have seen something unusual.”
「上に乗ったりはしなかったのか？　乗れば浦島太郎気分になれたかもな」=“Didn't you get to ride on it?　It would have made me feel like Urashima Taro.”
「さすがに触ったりはしてないよ。そもそも乗るのは絶対ダメだし」=“Of course I didn't touch it. I didn't touch it. I'm not supposed to get on it.”
「でも、竜宮城には行ってみたいなぁ……」=“But I'd like to go to the Dragon Palace. ......”
「フッ、いじめっ子たちを倒すのは私に任せろ」=“Leave it to me to defeat the bullies.”
「だから財宝を持ち帰ったら、分け前は半分だぞ」=“So if you bring back the treasure, you'll get half.”
「海岸の一帯が星の砂になってるのって、すごい見応えがありそうだよね」=“It would be amazing to see the whole beach covered in star sand, wouldn't it?”
「そのかわり、裸足で歩くとめちゃくちゃ痛いんじゃないか？」=“But wouldn't it hurt like hell to walk barefoot?”
「ああ、確かに……なんか修行とかでありそうなシチュエーションだよね」=“Yeah, it looks like something you'd see in a training session at .......”
「多分、俺はまともに歩けないんだろうなぁ」=“Maybe I won't be able to walk properly.”
「なんだ、情けない。男ならもっと気合いを入れろ」=“What a pity. If you're a man, you need to put more energy into it.”
「よし、お土産の星の砂を買って練習だな」=“All right, I'll buy some star dust as a souvenir and practice.”
「いやいや、わざわざそれをするのはもったいないって」=“No, no, no. It's a waste of time to do that.”
「ウムイの鐘の音色がボクシングのゴングみたいだったらどうする？」=“What if the sound of the bells in Umui is like a boxing gong?”
「質問の意味も意図も分からん……」=“I don't know what the question is or what you're trying to do. ......”
「一緒に鳴らそうとした相手とのバトルが始まるってことなのか？」=“Does that mean you're going to start a battle with the person you're trying to ring it with?”
「うーん……そうなるのかな？」=“Hmmm ...... would that happen?”
「だとしたら、先手必勝だな。やられる前にやる」=“If that's the case, then we're ahead of the game. I'll do it before they do it.”
「結ばれるのは普通の縁じゃなくて、因縁の方だったってオチだね」=“I guess it's not the normal kind of fate that brings us together, it's the fate that brings us together.”
「赤ん坊って、どれくらいの大きさのおっぱいが好きなんだろ？」=“What size breasts do babies like?”
「やっぱり母乳の飲みやすさとかに差があるのかな？」=“Is there a difference in the ease of drinking breast milk?”
「……私が知ってるわけないだろ」=“...... How would I know?”
「自分で飲んでみて調べたらどうだ？」=“Why don't you try it for yourself and find out?”
「えっ、[H名]がおっぱいを飲ませてくれるの！？」=“What? [H名] lets me drink from her tits!”
「だ、誰もそんなことは言ってない！」=“No, no one said anything about that!”
「フェチズムってかなり深いと思うんだ」=“I think fetishism is pretty deep.”
「[H名]には何かフェチ的なこだわりとかないの？」=“Do you have any fetish obsessions with [H名]?”
「フェチかどうかはともかく、相手を攻めるのは割りと好きだな」=“Fetish or not, I do like to attack people.”
「えっ……けっこうＳなの？」=“Oh, ......, are you a bit of an S?”
「そこまで極端じゃない」=“It's not that extreme.”
「ただ、相手が反応する姿にそそられるだけだ」=“I'm just intrigued by the way they react.”
（……それはＳに該当すると思うんだけどなぁ）=...... I think that qualifies as S.
「欲求不満になったときってどんなことしてる？」=“What do you do when you're frustrated?”
「やっぱり一人で慰めたりとかするのかな」=“Do you comfort yourself?”
「ま、まぁ、そういうときもある……」=“Well, yeah, sometimes I do. ......”
「……おまえの方はどうなんだ？」=“What about you, ......?”
「え？　俺のひとりエッチに興味あるの？　いっぱい聞かせてあげてもいいよ」=“What about you?　Are you interested in having sex with me alone?　I'd love to hear all about it.”
「いや、いい！　聞いた私が悪かった！」=“No, thanks!　I'm sorry I asked!”
「初めてのエッチのときって、やっぱり辛かったのかな？」=“Was it hard the first time you had sex?”
「まぁ……膜が破れるときは、さすがに痛みが響いたな」=“Well, when the ...... membrane ruptured, the pain was very strong indeed.”
「堪えていると次第によくなって――」=“It got better and better as I held on.”
「って、変なこと言わせるな！　変態っ」=“Don't make me say it!　Pervert.”
「ははっ、ごめんごめん」=“Sorry, sorry, sorry.”
「でも、さすが[H名]って感じだね」=“But that's what [H名] is all about.”
「わ、私のことはもういいっ。おまえはどうなんだ？」=“Okay, enough about me. What about you?”
「人に言わせておいて自分はだんまりなんて許さないぞ」=“I don't like it when you make people talk and you don't talk.”
「うわっ、やぶ蛇だった……！」=“Oh, my God, that was a snake. ......!”
