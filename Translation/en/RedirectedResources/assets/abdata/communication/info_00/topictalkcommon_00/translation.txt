「観光地だけあって、レジャーの種類が豊富だよね」=“This place is full of things to do, huh? I guess it is a tourist spot.”
「そうね、なにをして遊ぶか迷っちゃうわ♡」=“Yep, there's so much, it's hard to pick one to enjoy♡”
「やってみたいレジャーってある？」=“Is there any activity you really wanna do?”
「色々あるけど、誰かと一緒に出来るならなんだって楽しめると思うわ」=“There's a few but, I think I could enjoy myself with anything as long as someone's doing it with me.”
「この島自体が、ひとつのレジャー施設って感じだよね」=“This entire island feels like a giant leisure facility unto itself, doesn't it?”
「たしかに、それは言い得て妙ね」=“For sure, that might just fit this place perfectly.”
「ただ散歩してるだけでも、なんか楽しい気分になるよね」=“Just walking around feels kinda fun, doesn't it?”
「そうねぇ……この島全体の空気感っていうのかしら？　それがのんびりとしてるから、心地良いのよね」=“Yeah... just the vibe in this place, you know? It's so relaxed, and comfy too.”
「こんなに身体を動かす機会って中々ないよね」=“You don't get to run around much like this back in the city, do you?”
「そうなの！　だから絶好のチャンスだと思って、いろんなアクティビティに挑戦してみてるわ」=“Yeah, exactly! That's why I'm trying to do some of everything, it's the perfect chance.”
「二人でできるアクティビティって何があるかな？」=“You think there's anything around that the two of us could do together?”
「なぁに？　デートのお誘い？」=“What~? Are you asking me out on a date~?”
「本当に自然豊かなところだよね」=“This place really is full of nature, isn't it?”
「うんうん、空気が美味しいわよね」=“Yepyep, the air's just delicious, isn't it?”
「この島固有の動物や植物って、どれくらいいるのかな？」=“Any idea how many unique plants and animal species they've got here?”
「詳しくは知らないけど……たくさんいてもおかしくなさそうよね」=“Not in detail but... it wouldn't be weird if there were a ton, would it?”
「この島に、まだ見つかってない新種の生き物とかいないかな？」=“Do you think there's still some species that they haven't discovered on this island?”
「ふふ、もし見つけたら、君が名前を付けられるかもしれないわね」=“Fufuh, if you do end up discovering one, you might get to name it.”
「この素敵な景観を汚してしまわない様に、俺たちも注意しないとね」=“We're gonna have to be careful too, huh? So that we don't make a mess of this beautiful place.”
「素晴らしい心掛けね。いつまでも、この自然を守っていきましょう」=“What a wonderful attitude. Let's protect this natural paradise forever.”
「都会だと、こんなに自然の音は聞こえてこないよね」=“You don't really hear nature all this much in the city, do you?”
「そうね……一人きりになると波の音や生き物の声が聞こえてきて、なんだか癒されるのよね」=“Yeah... even when you're all alone, the sound of the waves and all the criters are very soothing, aren't they?”
「こんな自然に囲まれた場所に、別荘がほしくなるなぁ……」=“With so much nature all around us, I kinda want a holiday home here...”
「ふふっ、それじゃあ頑張ってお金持ちにならないといけないわね♡」=“Fufuh--, well then, you're just gonna have to do your best and become a rich guy, huh?♡”
「熱帯魚を見てたら、アクアリウムに凝る人の気持ちが分かった気がするよ」=“I finally understood what all those aquarium nerds were on about, when I looked at some of those tropical fish.”
「カラフルでかわいいものね～。犬や猫とはまた違った魅力があると思うわ」=“They're really colorful and adorable, aren't they~? I think they've got a different sort of appeal to them than a dog or a housecat.”
「この島の水平線って、本当に空と海が一つに繋がってるように見えるよね」=“The horizon here really does seem like it's connecting the sky and sea together, doesn't it?”
「空も海も綺麗だものね」=“Both the sky and the sea are so clean and beautiful, afterall.”
「浜辺にたまに綺麗な丸っこいガラスが落ちてるよね」=“You sometimes come across those really pretty round glass things on the shore, don't you?”
「シーグラスって言うのよ。いくら綺麗でも、持ち帰るのは禁止されてるからダメよ？」=“It's called sea glass. And no matter how pretty it is, you can't take any home, it's banned, okay?”
「海の生き物たちは、めちゃくちゃ広い海の中で出会って結ばれてるんだよね……すごいなぁ」=“The things that live under the sea, somehow find each other and reproduce in a place that wide, don't they... amazing.”
「たしかに、とてもロマンチックな話ね。私達が出会えたのと同じくらい♡」=“Certainly, it's very romantic. Just as romantic as us meeting each other♡”
「海の生き物って、なんであんなに不思議な形をしてるんだろうね？」=“I wonder why marine life takes such insane shapes sometimes?”
「う～ん、深く考えたことなかったわ。でも確かに不思議よね、深海魚なんてエイリアンみたいな見た目してるし……」=“Nnnn~, I've never really thought about it. But you're not wrong, the fish that live in the deep sea look especially alien...”
「もし、海の生き物になれるとしたら何になりたい？」=“If you could be any one animal from the sea, what would you want to be?”
「えぇっ、難しい質問ね……うーん、イルカかしら。優雅に泳いでいて気持ち良さそうよね」=“Eeh--, that's a difficult one... nnnn, I guess dolphins. The way they swim just looks so graceful and fun, doesn't it?”
「普段食べてるものと、味付けの仕方がけっこう違うよね」=“The way they flavour the food here is pretty different from back home, isn't it?”
「違いについて調べてみたら、面白いことが分かるかもしれないわね」=“Feels like we'd end up finding some really interesting stuff if we ever tried to look at exactly how different it is, doesn't it?”
「せっかくなら、ここの食べ物と飲み物を全部制覇してみたんだよね」=“It'd be a real shame to go back home without sampling all the food and drinks atleast once, wouldn't it?”
「どれくらい種類があるか分からないけど、出来ないことはないんじゃない？」=“We probably could do it, no? I mean, not that I know how many unique dishes there are here.”
「自販機の飲み物でさえも、普段全然見かけないものが多いよね」=“Even the vending machines have stuff you never really see in the city, don't they?”
「どんな味がするんだろうって、ドキドキしながら買ってるわ」=“I buy different stuff with my heart pounding everytime, wondering what it's gonna taste like this time.”
「人へのプレゼントを選ぶのってなんか楽しくない？」=“Isn't it kinda fun to pick out presents for other people?”
「すごくわかるわ～。自分の為に買ってるわけじゃないのに、不思議よね」=“I feel you~. You're not even buying it for yourself, it's so weird.”
「お店で流れてるBGMとかって、どこかで買えないのかな？」=“You think they sell the BGM they play in the shops somewhere here?”
「あの陽気な曲よね？　案外ＣＤが売ってるんじゃないかしら」=“You mean that jovial song, right? They probably do sell it as a CD, no?”
「一番この島らしい名産品ってなんだと思う？」=“What do you think is the most representative piece of local goods here?”
「一番って言われると難しいわね……どれもこの地域の特色が出ているもの」=“That's a pretty darn hard question... I mean, they all exude the local charm of this place.”
「もし一日だけ女の子になれるとしたら、まずオナニーはするだろうなぁ」=“If I could be a girl for just a day, I'd probably start off with masturbating, yeah.”
「確かに男女の感じ方の違いは気になるわね。私も男の子になれたら、やってみようかしら」=“It's only natural to be curious about the other sex's sensations, isn't it? Maybe I'll do that too, if I get to be a boy.”
「どんな風にエッチに誘ったらきゅんとくるかな？」=“What sort of an invite for sex would make your heart skip a beat?”
「そうねぇ……やっぱりムードを大切にしてくれることかしら」=“Good question~... It really is all about setting the right mood for me, I suppose.”
「おまんこって、もう言葉の響きからエッチだよね」=“Just the word "pussy" alone sounds really lewd, doesn't it?”
「なぁに？　私の口から言わせようとしてるの？　ふふ、そういうのはベッドの中でね……♡」=“What~? Are you trying to make me say it myself? Fufuh, save that for the bedroom, okay?...♡”
「うーん、そういう話をしたい気分じゃないの」=“Nnnn, I'm not in the mood for that stuff.”
「君はエッチな話しか出来ないわけじゃないでしょ？　他の話をしてちょうだい」=“It's not like that's all you know how to talk about, right? Talk about something else.”
