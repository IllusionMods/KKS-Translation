「最初は怪しいヤツだと思ったけど、キミは悪いヤツじゃないな」=“At first, I thought you were a suspicious guy. But you're actually not a bad person.”
「え、どうして悪いヤツじゃないってわかったの？」=“Eh, how do you know that I'm not a bad person?”
「ニオイで大体わかるぞ」=“I can almost always tell by the way someone smells.”
「へ～、ニオイでそんなことわかるんだ……」=“Ahem~ You can tell, just by the smell...”
「でも、ニオイじゃわからないこともあるから、色んな話をしてもっとキミのこと教えてほしいぞ」=“But there's things I can't figure out by way they smell, so I'd like to talk to you, and learn more about you.”
「もちろん。これからもよろしくね」=“Of course. I'll keep in touch.”
「うん！　よろしく！」=“Yeah! Let's work together!”
「あ、もう時間だぞ。また話そ、じゃーねー♪」=“Ah, it's time for me to go. We'll talk again, see ya-♪”
