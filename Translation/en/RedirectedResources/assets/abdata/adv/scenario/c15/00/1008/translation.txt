「…………波が」=“...The wave.”
「海ほたるだね……すごい」=“It's filled with sea fireflies, isn't it... amazing.”
「これはちょっとすごすぎるぞー。波の中にお星さまがあるなんて」=“This is a bit too amazing~. To think the wave would be filled with stars like this.”
「……あっちもこっちも。海がお星さまでピカピカだ」=“...Over there, and over there, just all over. It's all glowing with stars.”
「本当だね。もっと淡い輝きなのかと思った」=“It really is. I really thought they were gonna look a lot more like fire.”
「こんなの見せられたら、人間が何やっても敵わないなー」=“In front of a sight like this, there's no way humans can compare, no matter what we do~”
「クリスマスとか色々あるだろ？　町でこういう明かりを見たことある」=“I mean, there's christmas, no? I've seen the city glow like this before.”
「その時だってまぶしいなー、キレイだなーって思ったけど」=“It's really dazzling and pretty at those times--”
「このピカピカには敵わないぞ。どんなイルミネーションとかよりも、この海はずっとキレイで……」=“But it can't compare to this. This sight is so much prettier, than any lighting could ever be, and...”
「キレイで？」=“and?”
「あはは、言葉が続かなくなっちゃったなー」=“Ahahah, I ran out of words to say there~”
「……無理に言葉にしなくたっていいよ」=“...I mean, it's not like you have to put it in words.”
「一番大切なのは、俺達がこうやって一緒にここにいるってことだから」=“What's important is, us being here together like this, after all.”
「ふふ、そうかもしれないなー」=“Fufuh, maybe~”
「一人だったら、きっと……ちょっとくらいは虚しかったかもだ」=“If I was alone, this probably... would have felt a bit empty.”
「キレイだなー？　ねー？　……って、感動を分けあうこともできないんだもんなー」=“Hey look, isn't it really pretty~? Isn't it~?... I wouldn't have been able to share that with anyone~”
「それは確かに、ちょっと損した気分かな」=“For sure, that does seem like quite the loss.”
「うん、一人は損だ。二人がいい」=“Yep, you lose out by being alone. Gotta be with someone.”
「海ほたるだっけ？　こいつらも仲間と一緒だから寂しくないなー」=“Sea fireflies, were they? Bet these guys aren't lonely either, since they're with their buddies~”
「仲間……か。そういう見方をすると、急にこの景色がほのぼのした印象になったかも」=“Buddies... huh? Looking at it that way, I feel like it suddenly became a lot more of a heartwarming sight.”
「かけっこだぞ。運動会だ」=“They're racing. It's a sports meet.”
「あははははは、それいいね。海ほたるの運動会か」=“Ahahahahahah, that's pretty good. A sports meet of sea fireflies, huh?”
「そんなに面白かったか？」=“Was it that funny?”
「うん。[H名]と一緒にいると、笑ってばかりだ」=“Yep. Man, when I'm with you, I just can't help but laugh at everything.”
「おー、いいことだな？　人間たくさん笑わないと気持ちまで落ち込んじゃう」=“Oh~, that's good, innit? People gotta laugh tons, else they'll just get depressed.”
「あたしもだぞ。キミといると楽しくて、いつもニコニコだ」=“Goes for me too. Being with you's so fun, you never see me not smiling, I bet.”
「今日だってそうだ。キミと一緒にいると、楽しいことも素敵なこともたくさんだからな」=“It's the same today. When I'm with you, things are always so fun and wonderful.”
「これからもそうなるといいね」=“Hopefully things keep being like this.”
「きっと、そうなるぞ。あたしの野生の勘は当たるんだ」=“I bet they will. My wild sense never lies.”
「あはは、それは信ぴょう性高そうだ」=“Ahahah, how reliable.”
