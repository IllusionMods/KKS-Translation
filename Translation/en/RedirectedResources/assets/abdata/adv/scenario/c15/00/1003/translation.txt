「ちょっとお店を見てこうよ」=“Let's go take a look at the shop.”
「おー、いいぞー」=“Oh~, sure~”
「それ気に入ったの？　アロハシャツかな」=“You like that? Looks like an aloha shirt.”
「気に入ったってわけじゃないぞ？　なんとなく手に取っただけだ=I mean, I wouldn't say that. I just ended up grabbing it.
「いいんじゃない？　[H名]はアロハ似合いそうだよ」=“Isn't it nice? Seems like it'd suit you.”
「似合う？　なんでだ」=“You think so? Why?”
「……なんとなくかな？」=“...I just do, I guess?”
「あはは、あたしの真似っこだー」=“Ahahah, now you're just copying me~”
「まあいいか。キミが似合うって言うなら、これあたしのお土産にしよっかな」=“Well, whatever. If you think it'll look good on me, I'll buy this as my souvenir.”
「なんなら俺が買ってプレゼントしよっか？」=“How about I buy it and gift it to you then.”
「そんなのしなくていいから、キミはキミのお土産を買うんだぞ」=“You don't need to bother with that, you should buy something for yourself.”
「それも味気なくない？　あ、じゃあ[H名]は俺のを選んでよ。それで贈り合うってことで……どうかな」=“Doesn't that feel a bit boring though? Ah, you pick something for me then. And then we can gift something to each other... how about that?”
「う！？　そ、それはちょっと、あたしには難しすぎるなー……」=“Uu!? T-That might be, a bit too high bar for me to jump across~...”
「キミに似合う贈り物か。ち、ちょっと時間がほしいぞ、すぐには決められない」=“Something that'd look good on you, huh? I-I'm gonna need some time here, what a quest you've handed down.”
（自分のはあんなに簡単に決めたのに……）=(Even though she picked out something for herself so easily...)
