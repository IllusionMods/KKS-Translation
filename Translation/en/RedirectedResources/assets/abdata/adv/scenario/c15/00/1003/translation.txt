「ちょっとお店を見てこうよ」=“Let's check out the store.”
「おー、いいぞー」=“Oh- Okay-”
「それ気に入ったの？　アロハシャツかな」=“You like that? It's a Hawaiian shirt, I think.”
「気に入ったってわけじゃないぞ？　なんとなく手に取っただけだ=“I didn't say I liked it, okay? I just ended up with it, for some reason.”
「いいんじゃない？　[H名]はアロハ似合いそうだよ」=“What's wrong with it? You'd look good in a Hawaiian shirt, [H名].”
「似合う？　なんでだ」=“It'd suit me? I don't get it.”
「……なんとなくかな？」=“...you don't get it?”
「あはは、あたしの真似っこだー」=“Ahaha, you're trying to copy me-”
「まあいいか。キミが似合うって言うなら、これあたしのお土産にしよっかな」=“Well, whatever. If you're telling me I'd look good, then I guess this'll be my souvenir.”
「なんなら俺が買ってプレゼントしよっか？」=“I could buy it and gift it to you, if that's what you'd like, okay?”
「そんなのしなくていいから、キミはキミのお土産を買うんだぞ」=“You don't have to do that. Buy your own souvenirs.”
「それも味気なくない？　あ、じゃあ[H名]は俺のを選んでよ。それで贈り合うってことで……どうかな」=“I'd just get something tasteless then, wouldn't I? Ah, pick one for me, [H名]. We could give them to each other as gifts... so how about it?”
「う！？　そ、それはちょっと、あたしには難しすぎるなー……」=“Uuu?! Th-that's a little too much for me-...”
「キミに似合う贈り物か。ち、ちょっと時間がほしいぞ、すぐには決められない」=“A gift that suits you... I-I need some time... I can't decide right off the bat.” 
（自分のはあんなに簡単に決めたのに……）=(I made my decision so easily...)
