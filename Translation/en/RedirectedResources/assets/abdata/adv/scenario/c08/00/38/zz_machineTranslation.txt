「ん～、本当に色々なことが出来るんだねぇ。何をするか迷っちゃうよ」=“I'm not sure what to do. I can't decide what to do.”
「一番やりたことから、一つずつやってみる？　時間はあるから焦らなくていいよ」=“Why don't you start with the things you want to do the most and do them one by one?　There's still time, so there's no rush.”
「そうだね。でも楽しみはとっておきたいから、二番目に気になるこれにしようかなぁ」=“That's true. But I want to have some fun, so I think I'll go for the second one I'm interested in.”
「おお……またけっこう激しそうなのを選んだね」=“Oh, ......, you picked a pretty violent one again.”
「やめておいた方がいいと思う？」=“Do you think it's better if I don't?”
「ううん、最初に言った通り[H名]のやりたいことをやろう！　俺はずっと付き合うよ」=“No, as I said in the beginning, let's do what [H名] wants to do!　I'll keep you company.”
