「ちょっとお店を見てみようよ」=“Let's take a look around the stores.”
「ねえねえ、これ見て。可愛い狛犬のキーホルダーが売ってるよぉ」=“Hey, hey, look at this. There's a cute little guardian dog key chain for sale.”
「狛犬じゃなくて獅子を模した神獣だね。島の守り神様なんだよ」=“It's not a guardian dog, it's a lion-like creature. They are the guardian gods of the island.”
「へぇ～、そうなんだぁ。ワンちゃんじゃなくてライオンだったんだねぇ」=“Oh, really? It's not a puppy, it's a lion.”
「口を開いてる子と閉じてる子がいるけど、何か違いがあるの？」=“What's the difference between an open-mouth lion and a closed-mouth lion?”
「口が開いてる獅子は幸運を招き寄せて、口を閉じてる獅子は災いを封じる力があるんだ」=“A lion with an open mouth brings good luck, and a lion with a closed mouth has the power to ward off evil.”
「夫婦の獅子神様で、二つ一組で家の入り口に置くと御利益があるんだって」=“It's a couple of lion gods. They say it's good to put them in pairs at the entrance of the house.”
「じゃあじゃあ、買うならセットで買わないと」=“Well, well, well. If you're going to buy a set, you have to buy a set.”
「ラブラブ仲良し夫婦なのに、離ればなれになったら可哀想だよぉ」=“It would be a shame if they got separated when they're so in love.”
「だったら俺もキーホルダーを買うよ。俺と[H名]とで持ち歩けば、ずっと一緒にいられるでしょ？」=“Then I'll buy a key chain too. Me and [H名] can carry it around with us and we can be together forever, can't we?”
「うん！　私達も二人で一組。ラブラブなカップルだもんね。えへへ♪」=“Yes!　We're a couple, too. We're a loving couple, aren't we? Heh heh.”
