「そうだね、地元の人が普段食べているようなものを注文してみたいね」=“You're right. I'd like to try ordering something that the locals usually eat.”
「うんうん、あ、これなんかどう？」=“Yeah, yeah... ah, how about this one?”
「それは……なかなかチャレンジャーだと思うけど……」=“That'll be... quite the challenge, I think...”
「折角来たんだし、これで私達の思い出も増えるって思えば安いものでしょ？　ほらほら」=“It's a good thing we're here, because it's going to add to our memories.　There you go.”
