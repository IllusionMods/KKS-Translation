「ほんと綺麗な音色……この先、この音を聞く度に今の事を思い出すんだろうなぁ」=“Such a beautiful tone... from now on, every time I hear this sound, I'll remember what we're doing now.”
「そうだね。印象に残りやすい音だし、[H名]と一緒に体験してるってのもあるだろうしね」=“I agree. The sound leaves a lasting impression... but also the fact that I got to experience it with you, [H名].”
「こういうのって録音とか出来ないのかな？　二人で歳をとった時にふと聞いてみるとか面白そうだし」=“You think it's possible to record something like this? It might be interesting to listen to when we both get old.”
「どうだろう、あとで聞いてみよっか？」=“I guess... should I ask you about it later?”
「まぁその為にはもっと上手く弾けるようにならないとーだけどね……さ、練習しましょ？」=“Well, then I'll have to learn to play better for all that... come on, let's practice, shall we?”
