「この配色、どうかな？」=What do you think of this color scheme?
「うん、いい感じじゃない？　というか私の配色とほぼ同じ？」=Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?　I mean, it's almost the same as my color scheme?
「あー、そっちをちらほら見てたからかな……ぱ、パクリじゃないよ？」=Oh, maybe it's because I've been looking at that ...... stuff a lot.
「ふふっ、わかってるわよ、それにキミの視線も、ね？」=I know, and I can see it in your eyes, can't I?
