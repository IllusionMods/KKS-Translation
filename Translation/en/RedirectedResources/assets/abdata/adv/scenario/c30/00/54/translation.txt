「突然なんだけど、お互いのことを愛称で呼んでみない？　結構楽しいと思うんだ」=“I know this is quite abrupt, but, wanna try calling each other by nicknames? I think it'll be pretty fun.”
「愛称ね……そういうのって……何て言うか……人前だとちょっと恥ずかしくない？　その……ラブラブ過ぎるっていうのかしら……？」=“Nicknames, huh? That kind of thing... How do I say this... Wouldn't it be too embarrassing in front of others? That is... Wouldn't we look too soppy and sweet?”
「いやいや、そんな深く考えなくていいよ。どっちかと言えば、友達同士で呼び合うくらいの感じで……ひとまずお試しでダメかな？」=“You don't have to overthink it. If anything, don't friends call each others by nicknames? It'll be the same sort of feeling. For now, can't we do it just as a test?”
「ううん。キミがそうしたいならやってみましょう」=“Alright. If you're so interested in it, then let's do it.”
「やったね！　それじゃ……俺のことは[Pあだ名]って呼んでほしいな」=“Yay! Then... Can you call me by [Pあだ名]?”
「わわっ、私が付けるんじゃなくて、自分で決めてるのね……しかもその呼び方……本当にそれでいいの？」=Wawa! So instead of me picking one, you already picked one out for yourself beforehand? And a nickname like that to boot... Are you sure about it?”
「うん。この呼び方がいい。[H名]から、こうやって呼ばれたいんだ」=“Yeah. That name is fine. I'd like you to call me by that name.”
「もう……そう言われたら悪い気はしないけど……その、私から言うのは恥ずかしいから、先にキミが呼んでくれる？」=“Geez... if you say so, then I won't feel bad about it... but, that is, it's embarrassing for me to say it first. Won't you call me by my nickname first?”
「全然いいよ。実は自分のだけじゃなくて、[H名]の愛称も考えてたんだよね」=“I don't mind at all. Actually, I have already thought of a good nickname for you, [H名], alongside my own.”
「ずいぶん準備がいいのね」=“You're awfully well prepared.”
「あはは……えっと、それじゃあ呼ぶね。……[Hあだ名]」=“Ahaha... Uhm, then I'll say it... [Hあだ名].”
「なぁに、[Pあだ名]」=“What is it~, [Pあだ名].”
「いい……すごくいいよ！」=“That's good... no, it's great!”
「ふふ、ちょっと気恥ずかしかったけど、喜んでもらえて嬉しいわ。それに、素敵な愛称まで付けてもらえて……」=“Fufu~, I was a bit embarrased, but seeing you be so excited makes me happy. In addition, you also gave me such a nice nickname...”
「お試しじゃなくて、ずっとこう呼び合っていたいな」=“Aside from the test, It would be so nice if you would use that nickname everytime...”
「それじゃあ、本当にバカップルよ。でも……節度を守ってたまになら、いいかもね♪」=“If we do that, we really would look like lovebirds. But I suppose in moderation... it would be nice ♪”
