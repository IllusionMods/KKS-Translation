「その気持ちは分かんないんだけど……」=“I don't think I relate...”
「マジで？　何かに感動したときとかさ、自分中で気持ちがぐわーって湧き上がって来たりしないのか？」=“Really? Do you like not feel those sorts of feelings well up inside you, whenever you're moved by something or other?”
「まあ、感動した時に感情が込み上げることはあるけど……それをそのまま言葉にはしないかな」=“Well, when I'm moved by something, for sure, I do feel emotions but... I wouldn't go out of my way to put them into words, I guess?”
「そうなんだな……そういう時は自分の感情に素直になった方がいいと思うぜ。こんな風にさ……最高だぁー！！」=“I see... I think you'd enjoy it a lot more just being honest to your own feelings at times like that. Like this... this is the best~!!”
「周りの迷惑になるって！」=“We're gonna end up being an annoyance, dummy!”
