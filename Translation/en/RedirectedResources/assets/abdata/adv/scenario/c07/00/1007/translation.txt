「さすが南国の水族館。雰囲気あるね」=“Guess that's a southern island aquarium for you. It's got a real mood to it.”
「ああ！　これはもはや、あれだな……ちっちゃな海だな！！」=“Yeah! This is almost, you know... a whole tiny ocean in there!!”
「あはは、テンション高いね」=“Ahahah, you're pretty excited.”
「そりゃそうだろ。せっかく南国に来たんだから、海の生き物と戯れないと」=“Of course I am. We came all this way, we gotta enjoy the marine life too.”
「……お触りはできそうにないけど」=“...Don't think we can actually touch them though.”
「ぅ……さすがに南国だけあって、南国っぽい魚が多いな」=“Uu... there's a whole lot of southern looking fish in here, huh? I guess because it's a southern island.”
「南国っぽいって、マンタとか？」=“You mean like mantas and whatnot?”
「おお、マンタもいるかもしれないな。探そうぜ」=“Ooh, there might be those in here for sure. Let's go look for 'em.”
…………=...
「おー、でっかい亀……見ろよ？　顔が仙人っぽいぞ。人間の言葉とか喋りそう」=“Ooh, what a big turtle... look. It looks like a mountain hermit. Feels like it's gonna start talking to us.”
（マンタ探すのでは……）=(Weren't we looking for mantas...)
「よく見たら亀の大群じゃん。亀って意外とスイスイ泳ぐんだな」=“Now that I'm looking, ain't it a whole turtle herd? Turtles swim pretty smoothly, don't they? Never coulda imagined.”
「目がキラキラしてるよ？　[H名]って海の生き物が好きなんだ」=“Your eyes are really sparkling there, you know? I didn't know you loved marine life so much.”
「海が好き……かな？　ロマンっていうの？　何かこう、胸にぐーって迫るものがあるだろ」=“It's more that I love the... sea, I guess? What do they call it, the romance of it all? It's like, I feel it in my chest.”
「はっ！？　もしかして私の前世、人魚だったり」=“Hah--!? Maybe in my past life, I mighta been a mermaid.”
「……まあ、可能性はあるな。全ての生き物のルーツは海って言うし」=“...Well, who knows. They do say all life came outta the sea, after all.”
「いやいや、そこはツッコミだろ？　お前みたいなガサツなののどこが人魚だー、とか」=“No no, normally you'd retort at that point, no? Like, which part of your rough ass could be a mermaid, and all.”
「[H名]は人魚似合うよ！」=“Nah, you'd make a great mermaid, [H名]!”
「余計なこと言わなきゃよかった……」=“I shouldn't have said a thing...”
