「で、海に来てみたけど、何をして遊ぶのかしら？」=“So, we're at the beach, but are we going to do something?”
「そうだなぁ……うーん、[H名]さんと遊びたくて誘ったんだけど、実は何をしようかは特に考えてなくて……」=“I suppose... hmmm, I invited you out to play, [H名], but I didn't actually have a specific idea of what we'd be doing.”
「あら、そんなに私と遊びたかったのかしら？」=“Oh, you wanted to play with me that badly?”
「まあ、折角こんないいとこに来たんだしね」=“I mean, why waste a trip to such a nice place you know?”
「ふふっ、思ってたより仕方ない人ね……そういうときは、一緒に何をするか考えればいいのよ？」=“Hmm, I can't help it more than I expected ... In that case, what should I do together?”
「そ、そうだね……二人で考えてみよっか」=“R-right... let's see what we can figure out together.”
