「[H名]さん、こっちは回遊魚の水槽だって」=“[H名]-san, these are migratory fish, apparently.”
「すごい……魚の群れというより、動き方が同じ過ぎて一匹の魚みたいね」=“Amazing... rather than a school of fish, their movement is so coordinated they almost look like one single fish, don't they?”
「子供の頃に、国語の時間でこんな魚たちのお話を読んだけれど、これはたしかに驚くわ」=“I remember reading about fish like these during Japanese class back when I was a kid but, it really is something else to look at them yourself, isn't it?”
「あ、[H名]さんのところもその話やったんだ、懐かしいなぁ」=“Ah, your school had them too, huh? How nostalgic.”
「定番なのね。こうやって魚群を作って、大きな魚を追い払う物語だったわ」=“It's pretty standard, I see. I remember, it was a story about how they all formed into a single school of fish, and drove away a giant predator fish.”
「そうそう……でもそっか、当たり前だけど[H名]さんにも子供だった頃があったんだよね」=“Yep, that... but, I see. I mean, it's obvious in hindsight but I guess you were a kid once too, huh?”
「ふふっ、なあにいきなり。人をアンドロイドか何かみたいに言わないで頂戴」=“Fufuh--, what's with that? Could you not go and treat me like an android who just woke up one day~?”
「ごめんごめん、逆に想像できなくて」=“Sorry, sorry. I just couldn't imagine it.”
「どこにでもいる普通の子だったわよ。でも、いまと比べると随分活発な女の子だったんじゃないかしら」=“I was just a normal kid, you know. As normal as any other. But, I suppose I was a whole lot more vivacious back then, atleast compared to now.”
「たとえば？」=“Like how?”
「そうね……それこそ、こうやって水族館に連れてきてもらうと、一日中見て回って、お土産までちゃっかり買ってもらうタイプね」=“Let's see... like, for example, if my parents ever took me to an aquarium, I'd run around the place all day, and even have them buy me a souvenir on the way out.”
「あはは、それじゃ今もあまり変わらないんじゃない？　いろんな水槽を見る[H名]さん、目をキラキラさせてたよ」=“Ahahah, is that any different from now though? Your eyes have been glittering the whole time we've been here, you know?”
「ふぅん。じゃあお土産も買ってもらっちゃおうかしら」=“Hmmmm. Maybe I'll have you buy me a souvenir too then.”
「この島の魚の図鑑がいいかな？　それともぬいぐるみとか？」=“How about a picture book of all the fish here? Or would you rather have a plushie instead?”
「もう、冗談よ」=“Jeez, I was joking, dummy.”
「俺は知ってるよ。冗談を言う時の[H名]さんは照れてるときだってね]=You know, [H名], I know. I know that when you joke, you do it to hide your blush.
「はいはい。あなたには適わないわ、ふふふ」=“Yes yes. I just can't win against you, can I? Fufufuh~”
「でも、普通に二人で水族館に来た思い出は買いたいよね。お土産コーナーも寄っていこうよ」=“But, it'd be nice to buy something to look back on this day, wouldn't it? Let's go check out the gift shop, c'mon.”
「ふふっ、そうね。嬉しかったから私が買ってあげる。なんでも好きなものを選んで頂戴」=“Fufuh--, sure. You made me really happy today so I'll buy something for you. Pick anything you like.”
（……？　照れる[H名]さんが可愛くて、ついからかっちゃったけど、それが嬉しかったのかな……？）=(...? She looked adorable hiding her blush, so I ended up teasing her over it but, did that make her happy...?)
