「[H名]さん……人生何周目？」=“How many times have you been around ... life, [H名]?”
「残念ながら１周目よ♡　とにかく、私はあなた以外に好きな人なんてできないから安心して。この気持ちは魔法でも理屈でもないの」=“Anyway, you can rest assured that I can't love anyone else but you. This feeling is neither magical nor logical.”
（最後に全部ひっくり返されちゃった……でも、それが平等ってことか。なんか、[H名]さんにはいつまでも敵いそうにないな）=(It all got turned upside down at the end ... but I guess that's what equality is all about. I don't know, I don't think I'm going to be able to compete with [H名] anytime soon)
