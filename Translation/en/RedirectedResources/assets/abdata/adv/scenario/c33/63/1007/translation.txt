「[H名]さん、こっちは回遊魚の水槽だって」=“[H名], this one says it's a tank for migratory fishes.”
「すごい……魚の群れというより、動き方が同じ過ぎて一匹の魚みたいね」=“Wow... it's not a school of fish. It's more like a single fish that moves in the same way.”
「子供の頃に、国語の時間でこんな魚たちのお話を読んだけれど、これはたしかに驚くわ」=“When I was a kid, I we'd read stories about fishes like these in class, but yeah, it's even more astonishing when you see it in person.”
「あ、[H名]さんのところもその話やったんだ、懐かしいなぁ」=“Ah, so your school teach them too huh, [H名]. Wow, that brings me back.”
「定番なのね。こうやって魚群を作って、大きな魚を追い払う物語だったわ」=“It's a classic. It was a story about a how the smaller fishes team up to create a school to get rid of a bigger fish.”
「そうそう……でもそっか、当たり前だけど[H名]さんにも子供だった頃があったんだよね」=“That's right... It's obvious now that I think about it, but you were a kid once too huh [H名].”
「ふふっ、なあにいきなり。人をアンドロイドか何かみたいに言わないで頂戴」=“Fufu! Hey, come on now. Don't talk to me like I'm a robot, or something.”
「ごめんごめん、逆に想像できなくて」=“Sorry, sorry, but seriously, I can't imagine it.”
「どこにでもいる普通の子だったわよ。でも、いまと比べると随分活発な女の子だったんじゃないかしら」=“I was just an ordinary kid that you'd anywhere. But maybe I was a much more active girl back then compared to now.”
「たとえば？」=“For example?”
「そうね……それこそ、こうやって水族館に連れてきてもらうと、一日中見て回って、お土産までちゃっかり買ってもらうタイプね」=“Let me think... I was that kind of kid that, if taken to the aquarium like we're doing now, would spend all day looking around, and even buys souvenirs on the way out.”
「あはは、それじゃ今もあまり変わらないんじゃない？　いろんな水槽を見る[H名]さん、目をキラキラさせてたよ」=“Ahaha, that's not much of a difference from now, is it? Your eyes all are sparkling when looking at the tanks, [H名] looking at all the tanks!”
「ふぅん。じゃあお土産も買ってもらっちゃおうかしら」=“Hmph. Then of course you'd buy me a souvenir too right?”
「この島の魚の図鑑がいいかな？　それともぬいぐるみとか？」=“OK then little miss, how about a picture book of fishes on this island? Or perhaps a plushie strikes your fancy?”
「もう、冗談よ」=“Come one, I was kidding.”
「俺は知ってるよ。冗談を言う時の[H名]さんは照れてるときだってね]=“Ah, but I know something that you perhaps don't. Did you know that you tend to joke a lot more when you're embarrassed, [H名]?”
「はいはい。あなたには敵わないわ、ふふふ」=“Yeah, yeah. I'm no match for you, fufufu.”
「でも、普通に二人で水族館に来た思い出は買いたいよね。お土産コーナーも寄っていこうよ」=“Jokes aside, I definitely want to buy something to remind us of coming to the aquarium together. Let's stop by the gift shop.”
「ふふっ、そうね。嬉しかったから私が買ってあげる。なんでも好きなものを選んで頂戴」=“Fufu! Sure. That made me very happy, so I guess I'll buy it for you. You can pick anything you like.”
（……？　照れる[H名]さんが可愛くて、ついからかっちゃったけど、それが嬉しかったのかな……？）=(...? [H名] is so cute when she's embarrassed that I had to tease her... but I guess she's happy that I did that...?)
