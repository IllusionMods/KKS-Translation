「で、海に来てみたけど、何をして遊ぶのかしら？」=So, now that we're at the beach, what are we gonna do for fun?
「そうだなぁ……うーん、[H名]さんと遊びたくて誘ったんだけど、実は何をしようかは特に考えてなくて……」=Well ......, I invited [H名] because I wanted to hang out with you, but I didn't really have any idea what we were going to do. ......
「あら、そんなに私と遊びたかったのかしら？」=Oh, did you want to play with me so badly?
「まあ、折角こんないいとこに来たんだしね」=Well, we've come to the right place, haven't we?
「ふふっ、思ったより仕方ない人ね……そういうときは、一緒に何をするか考えればいいのよ？」=Hmm, you're a lot harder to please than I thought. ...... When that happens, we'll figure out what to do together, okay?
「そ、そうだね……二人で考えてみよっか」=Yeah, yeah. ...... Let's see what we can come up with.
