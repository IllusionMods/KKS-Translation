「カヤックなら二人で楽しめるね」=“Kayaking can be fun for two people.”
「そうね。力を合わせて頑張るわよ！　あたしの足を引っ張らないでちょうだいね」=“Yeah. We're going to have to work together!　Don't drag me down with you.”
「任せてよ。しっかり息を合わせるから」=“I got it, I got it. You can count on me. We'll be in perfect sync.”
「ふっ、心配いらないみたいね。あんたになら背中を預けられるわ」=“Hmm, I guess I don't need to worry. I can put my back into it with you.”
「さぁ！　背中合わせで乗り込むわよ！」=“Come on!　We're going in back to back!”
「同じ方向を向いてなきゃ進まないよ」=“You can't move forward unless you're facing the same direction.”
