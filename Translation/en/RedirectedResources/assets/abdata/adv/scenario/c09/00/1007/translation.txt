「まるで海の中だね。キレイだなぁ」=“Almost feels like we're underwater, doesn't it? It's so pretty.”
「うふふ、口開けちゃって子供みたいよ」=“Ufufuh, you're like a little kid with your jaw wide open like that.”
「見惚れちゃうって、こんなの」=“Just about anyone would feel this way, looking at this.”
「そうね。水族館っていうとデートの定番って感じがするけど、納得感があるわ」=“You're not wrong. Aquariums really feel like the most bog standard date spot but, I can certainly see why.”
「薄暗くてムードあるし、みたいなこと？　映画館とかと同じかな」=“Because it's dark and moody? Almost like a movie theatre, in that way.”
「えっち！　あんたもさっき言ってたじゃない。幻想的でキレイだからってことよ」=“You perv! You said it yourself earlier too. It's because it's magical and really pretty.”
（なんでエッチって言われたんだ……)=(Why do I get called a perv for stating the obvious...)
「ほら、あの魚とか普通じゃないわよ。なんであんなにカラフルなのかしら」=“Look, that fish isn't normal. I wonder why it's so colorful?”

「クールぶっちゃって。あんたも楽しもうとしないと楽しめないわよ」=“Stop acting cool and try to enjoy yourself. Else you just won't.”
「そ、それとも、ちょっとはしゃぎすぎ？　いけないいけない、らしくなかったわね」=“O-Or am I getting too excited? Not good, not good, that really wasn't like me, was it?”
（すっごく[H名]らしいし、微笑ましいけど……）=(It's just like her, and really heartwarming to look at, just like a...)
「子供みたい、って思った？」=“Did you just think "just like a child" in your head?”
「全然？　せっかく来たんだから楽しめた方がいいに決まってるよ」=“Not at all? We came all the way here, so of course we should enjoy ourselves.”
「そうよね！　ほら、ぼやぼやしてないでもっと奥に行きましょ。あたし、ペンギン見たい」=“Right?! C'mon, don't just stand there like a dummy, let's go further in. I wanna see a penguin.”
「さすがにペンギンはいないと思う……」=“I really don't think they've got one of those here...”
