「まぶしいくらいに海がピカピカ光ってるわ……」=“The ocean's shining so brightly, it's dazzling...”
「海ほたるってやつかな」=“I think they're called 'sea fireflies'.”
「まるで光の洪水ね」=“It's like a flood of lights.”
「得しちゃったな。海ほたるって、そんなにしょっちゅう見られるようなものじゃないはずだし」=“I get it now. Sea fireflies aren't something you should get to see that often.”
「う、うん、キレイだけど……」=“Y-yeah, they're beautiful, but...”
「あたし、圧倒されちゃってるのかな？　だんだん怖くなってきたかも」=“They're overwhelming, you know? I might be getting scared.”
「怖い？」=“Scared?”
「直感的にそう思っただけだから、理由を聞かれても上手に説明はできないんだけど」=“I just had this gut feeling about them, and I wouldn't be able to explain it if you asked.”
「……言われてみたら、ちょっと不気味さもあるかも」=“...and if you ask me, it might be a little creepy.”
「そうでしょ？　お化け屋敷みたい」=“I know, right? It looks like a haunted house.”
（[H名]は物事の受け止め方が斬新だな……）=([H名] has a novel way of seeing things...)
「……あんたと一緒じゃなくて、あたし一人だったら悲鳴あげちゃってたかも」=“...if it'd been just me here without you, I would have screamed.”
「ただでさえも真っ暗で怖いのに。海の怪談とか思い出しちゃう」=“It's just so dark and scary. It reminds me of a ghost story about the ocean.”
「言われてみると、儚い光がちょっと霊魂っぽいかも」=“If you ask me, the fleeting lights kind of remind me of ghosts.”
「やめてよ！？　あ、あの一粒一粒がおばけだなんて……めちゃくちゃ怖いわ～～っ」=“Cut it out, okay!? I don't want to believe each of those specks is a ghost... now I'm freakin' scared~~!”
「大丈夫、大丈夫。いざって時は俺が守るから」=“It's alright, it's alright. I'll protect you when the time comes.”
「相手はおばけよ？　透けてるのに？」=“You'd deal with a ghost? Even though it's transparent?”
「余裕だよ。おばけだろうがなんだろうが、好きな人のためなら頑張れるから」=“I could handle it. I don't care if it's a ghost, or anything else, I'd do anything for the one I love.”
「余裕ではないと思うけど……いいわ、ちょっとだけアテにしてあげる」=“I don't think I could handle it... sure, so I'd kinda have to rely on you.”
「あんたって意外と頼もしいところがあるのよね」=“You really are quite reliable, aren't you?”
「怖くなくなった？」=“Not afraid anymore?”
「うん、もう平気」=“Yeah, not any more.”
「そっか」=“I see.”
「見れば見るほど不思議な光ね。空の星が落ちて、そのまま流されてきてるみたい」=“The more I look at it, the more mysterious the light is. It's like the stars have fallen, and are drifting away.”
「……やっぱり、ちょっと怖いわ。こうして見てると吸い込まれちゃいそう」=“...I'm still a little scared, after all. I feel like I'll be drawn into it as I look at it that way.”
「でも、うん、とってもキレイ」=“But, yeah, it's very pretty.”
