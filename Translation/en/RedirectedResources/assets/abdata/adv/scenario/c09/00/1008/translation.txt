「まぶしいくらいに海がピカピカ光ってるわ……」=“The sea's glowing so bright, it's almost dazzling...”
「海ほたるってやつかな」=“Must be sea fireflies.”
「まるで光の洪水ね」=“It's almost like a flood of light.”
「得しちゃったな。海ほたるって、そんなにしょっちゅう見られるようなものじゃないはずだし」=“We really lucked out this time. I don't think sea fireflies are something you see everyday.”
「う、うん、キレイだけど……」=“Y-Yeah, it's really pretty...”
「あたし、圧倒されちゃってるのかな？　だんだん怖くなってきたかも」=“Am I, being overwhelmed here? I think I'm getting scared.”
「怖い？」=“Scared?”
「直感的にそう思っただけだから、理由を聞かれても上手に説明はできないんだけど」=“I just had that sort of a feeling so, even if you ask me the why of it, I can't really explain it properly.”
「……言われてみたら、ちょっと不気味さもあるかも」=“...Now that you say it, it does feel a bit eerie, I think.”
「そうでしょ？　お化け屋敷みたい」=“Right? Like a haunted house or something.”
（[H名]は物事の受け止め方が斬新だな……）=(Her way of looking at things really is novel...)
「……あんたと一緒じゃなくて、あたし一人だったら悲鳴あげちゃってたかも」=“...If you weren't here and I was all by myself, I think I might have screamed.”
「ただでさえも真っ暗で怖いのに。海の怪談とか思い出しちゃう」=“The darkness by itself is scary enough. A sight like this on top would make me remember those sea ghost stories.”
「言われてみると、儚い光がちょっと霊魂っぽいかも」=“Now that you say it, such transient lights like that do look very spirit like.”
「やめてよ！？　あ、あの一粒一粒がおばけだなんて……めちゃくちゃ怖いわ～～っ」=“Could you not!? E-Each and every one of those being a ghost... would be super scary~~”
「大丈夫、大丈夫。いざって時は俺が守るから」=“Relax, don't worry. If it comes to it, I'll protect you.”
「相手はおばけよ？　透けてるのに？」=“You're gonna be up against ghosts, you know? You'd just go right through, you know?”
「余裕だよ。おばけだろうがなんだろうが、好きな人のためなら頑張れるから」=“It'll be fine. Whether it's ghosts or anything else, I can bring out my all to protect the girl I love.”
「余裕ではないと思うけど……いいわ、ちょっとだけアテにしてあげる」=“I really don't think it'll be fine though... but okay, I'll put my faith in you, just a little bit.”
「あんたって意外と頼もしいところがあるのよね」=“You're surprisingly reliable when it comes to it, you know?”
「怖くなくなった？」=“Feeling less scared?”
「うん、もう平気」=“Yep, I'm okay now.”
「そっか」=“I see.”
「見れば見るほど不思議な光ね。空の星が落ちて、そのまま流されてきてるみたい」=“The more I look at them, the more mysterious they seem. They almost look like stars, fallen from the sky yet still flowing without a care.”
「……やっぱり、ちょっと怖いわ。こうして見てると吸い込まれちゃいそう」=“...I really do feel, a bit scared. I feel like I'm gonna get swallowed up by it.”
「でも、うん、とってもキレイ」=“But, yeah, it's really pretty.”
