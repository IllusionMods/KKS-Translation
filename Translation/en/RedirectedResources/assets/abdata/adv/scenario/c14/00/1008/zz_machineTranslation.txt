「…………すごいね」=“............ Wow.”
「ああ、半端ねぇな。星が降り注いでやがる……」=“Oh, it's so great. The stars are falling. ......”
「うん、空が明るく見えるくらいだ」=“Yeah, the sky is so bright.”
「……やべえな」=“...... Oh, man.”
（[H名]、空に見惚れちゃってる……）=([H名], I've been admiring the sky...)
「あー……こんな時、バカだとダメだな。気の利いた言葉がなんにも出てこねぇ」=“Oh, ......, you can't be stupid at a time like this. I can't think of anything clever to say.”
「バカとか関係ないでしょ。俺も圧倒されてたよ」=“I don't care if you're stupid or not. I was overwhelmed, too.”
「圧倒か。ああ、それもそうなんだけどよ……気の利いたっていうのはそういうことじゃなくて」=“Overwhelming. Yeah, that's true, too. ...... That's not what I meant by clever.”
「あるだろ？　ろ、ろまんちっくっての？　大事だろ。こういうシーンでは」=“You do?　What's that?　It's important. In a scene like this.”
「女としてほら！　可愛いような……う、上手く言えねぇけど」=“As a woman, you know!　It's kind of cute, ......, I can't really describe it.”
「一緒にお願いごとしようよー、みたいなこと？」=“Like, do you want to do me a favor?”
「そう！　そういうの」=“Yes!　That's right!”
「って、そんなことお前に言われてる時点でグダグダじゃねぇかよ」=“It's not that I don't want to, but you need to use a more moody way of asking her out!”
「ぐだぐだの意味がわからないんだけど」=“I don't know what "goofy" means.”
「わかれよ！　こんな一生ものの、忘れられないような体験を二人でしてるんだから」=“You know what I mean!　We're having an unforgettable experience of a lifetime together.”
「……[P名]の記憶の中に、可愛い私として映っておきたいっていうか」=“... I want to be reflected in [P名]'s memory as the pretty me.”
「[H名]は可愛いよ」=“[H名] is lovely.”
「ふえ！？　こ、このタイミングでそういうこと……」=“What?　This is such a good time to ......”
「そういうピュアなところ好きだな」=“I like that kind of innocence.”
「……ピュアとか。わ、わけわかんねぇ」=“...... pure. I don't get it.”
「全部俺の本音で本当のことだよ。さっきの星空に見惚れてる顔、流れ星よりずっと強く胸に焼き付いてる」=“It's all true and real for me. The look on your face when you were gazing at the starry sky, it's etched in my mind more strongly than a shooting star.”
「ずっと忘れないよ、俺」=“I'll always remember you, man.”
「お、お前はいつもそうだな。くっそ……恥ずかしくなってきた」=“You're always doing that, aren't you? Damn, ...... I'm getting embarrassed.”
「照れ屋なところも可愛い」=“You're cute when you're shy.”
「ふん、言ってろバカ！」=“Huh, just say it, you idiot!”
「本心なのに。そうだ、[H名]が信じてくれるように流れ星に祈ろうかな」=“I mean it. Yes, I might pray to a shooting star for [H名] to believe me.”
「そ、そんな回りくどい真似しなくていいから！　もっとちゃんとしたこと祈れよ」=“I want you to smile and have fun with me. - No, you don't have to do that!　Pray more properly.”
「たとえば……二人がずっと一緒にいられるように、とか」=“Like, for example, ......, so that you two can be together forever.”
「うん、そうだね。そうしよう」=“Yes, you're right. Let's do that.”
「…………ああ」=“............ Oh.”
