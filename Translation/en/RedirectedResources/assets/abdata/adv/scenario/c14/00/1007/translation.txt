「水族館なんかデートのド定番って感じでよ……あ、違うぞ？　それが嫌とか楽しくないとか言いたいわけじゃなくて」=“An aquarium date is just such a bog standard date that... ah, that's not it, okay? I'm not trying to say that I don't like it or that I'm not having fun or anything, okay?”
「うんうん、それが恋だよ。恋人同士としての実感ってやつだ」=“Yepyep, that's love, dear. You're just experiencing what it means to be in love.”

「了解、エスコートするよ」=“Roger, I'll take you around.”
「……変なことになっちまったよな。私が男に頼るとか」=“...Took a pretty weird turn there, didn't it? Especially me relying on a man and all.”
「あ、向こうにマナティーいるらしいよ？　行ってみようか」=“Ah, seems like they've got a manatee over there. Let's go check it out?”
「マナティーってなんだ？」=“Heck's a manatee?”
「行けばわかるよ。ほら、エスコートってことで」=“You'll see. C'mon, I'm your guide for today.”
「へっ、調子くれやがって。マナティーがどれほどのみんか見てやろうじゃねぇか」=“Hoh--, someone's getting ballsy. Guess I'll see for myself just what sorta thing this manatee is.”
「マナティーにメンチ切るのやめてね」=“Don't glare at it with those eyes, alright?”
