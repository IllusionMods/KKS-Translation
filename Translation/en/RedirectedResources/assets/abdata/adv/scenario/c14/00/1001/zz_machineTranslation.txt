「ここ涼しいね。ちょっと休んでいこうか」=“It's cool here. Let's take a break.”
「……おい、こんなとこに私を誘って何を企んでやがる？」=“...... Hey, what are you planning on doing inviting me out here?”
「変かな？　涼みたかっただけだよ」=“Is that weird?　I just wanted to cool off.”
「ウソつけ。本当は私のこと油断させて、エロいこととか企んでやがるんだろ」=“You're lying. I'm not satisfied at all. - You're lying. You're just trying to get me to let my guard down so you can do something erotic.”
「えーと。つまり、キスしたいってこと？」=“I'm not sure. Does that mean you want to kiss me?”
「ばっ、あ、甘く見てんじゃねぇぞ！　やんのか」=“Don't underestimate me!　You're gonna do it?”
「キスを？」=“Kissing?”
「……バカにして。そういうつもりじゃねぇなら、否定だけすりゃいいんだよ」=“...... You're an idiot. If you don't mean it, just deny it.”
「で？　どうすんだ、これから」=“So?　What are you going to do now?”
「うん、だから涼みたいだけだって。[H名]も好きでしょ？　こういうの」=“Yeah, so he just wants to cool off. You like it too, don't you?　Like this.”
「なんで私がこういうの好きとか言えんだよ」=“Why are you rolling your eyes? - Why do you keep saying I like this?”
「え？　いつもコンビニの前でたむろして、肉まんとか食べてそうだから。近いノリで」=“What?　Because you always seem to be hanging out in front of the convenience store, eating buns and stuff. It's a close thing.”
「イメージで語るんじゃねぇよ！　……ま、まあ、してないわけじゃねえけどよ」=“Don't talk about it with images!　...... Well, it's not that I don't, but...”
「ほらやっぱり」=“I knew it.”
「はいはいそうな。そういや、ちょっと喉乾いたな？　ジュース買ってこいよ」=“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'm a little thirsty, aren't I?　Go get me some juice.”
「ナチュラルにパシリに使わないでくれる？」=“Don't use me as a natural pawn.”
「あははははは。冗談だよ、冗談」=“Ha-ha-ha-ha. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.”
「ふぅ、確かにここ涼しいな。いい気分だ」=“Hmm, it sure is cool in here. I feel good.”
（やっぱり、笑うと可愛いなぁ……）=(I knew she was cute when she smiled. ......)
「んだろ？　ジロジロ見やがって」=“Right?　You're staring at me like that.”
「……やっぱりキスする？」=“......Do you still want to kiss me?”
「や、やっぱりってなんだよ！　するかそんなの」=“What do you mean, "I knew it!　I'm not going to do that.”
