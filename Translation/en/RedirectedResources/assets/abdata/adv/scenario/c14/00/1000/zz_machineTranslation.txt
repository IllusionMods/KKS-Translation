「へえ、カップルドリンクが飲めるんだって。頼もうよ」=“Oh, they have couples drinks. Let's have one.”
「私のこと舐めてやがんのか？　バカにしやがって」=“Do you think I'm a fool?　You're making fun of me!”
「なんでいきなり攻撃的なのさ」=“Why are you being so aggressive all of a sudden?”
「勝手にこんなチャラついたもん頼みやがるからだ」=“That's what you get for asking me to do something so flashy.”
「二人で飲みたかったんだけど……」=“I wanted to have a drink with you. ......”
「私のキャラじゃねぇんだよ！　こ、こんなの二人で飲んだりしたら、浮かれてるみてぇだろうが」=“It's not my character!　This is not my character! If we were to drink together like this, it would look like I was floating around.”
「ダメなの？　俺は結構、浮かれちゃってるんだけど」=“No?　I'm getting a little carried away.”
「浮かれてんじゃねーぞ！」=“Don't get carried away!”
「そんな無茶な」=“That's absurd.”
「なんで無茶なんだよ」=“Why are you being so reckless?”
「楽しいから。もしかして、まだ実感ない？　俺達カップルなんだよ」=“It was fun. Are you still not feeling it?　We're a couple, you know.”
「そ、それは、わかってるっての。いちいち言うな」=“No, I know that. Don't tell me that.”
「わかってるならノリあわせてよ。一緒にドリンク飲んだり……」=“I know, I've made it so big. Have a drink with me. ......”
「そういうのはキャラじゃねーって言ってんだ！」=“I'm telling you, that's not a character!”
「こういうのもこれからはキャラにしていこうよ」=“I thought I would be embarrassed and not like this.”
「……覚悟決めろってことか。ま、まあ、確かに、ビビってんのも私のキャラじゃねぇか」=“...... You mean I should be prepared? I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.”
「上等だ、カップルドリンクくらい軽くシメてやるよ」=“I think I did a good job. I had a lot of fun.”
「可愛いなぁ、[H名]は」=“[H名] is so cute.”
「バカにすんなって言ってんだろ！」=“I said don't be an asshole!”
「あはは」=“Ha-ha.”
