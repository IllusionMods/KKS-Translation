「ねえ、浜辺を散歩しない？」=“Hey, wanna go take a walk down the beach?”
「ごほん！　な、なんか、アレだな。なんていうか……アレだ」=“*Cough*! I-It's kinda, you know, that. How do I say this... it's, you know?”
「どれ？」=“Do I?”
「アレはアレだよ！　まあ、そのことは別によくて……」=“You do, you know! Well, that doesn't really matter...”
「と、ところで、海って言えばよ！」=“B-By the way, about the sea!”
「さっきからなんでそんなにぎくしゃくしてるの？」=“What's got you straining like that?”
「別にぎくしゃくはしてねぇけどよ。ちょっと、あ、アレだ……思っちまっただけだ」=“I'm not strained or anything. It's just, t-that, you know... I just ended up thinking, you know?”
「男と並んで砂浜を歩くとか、青くせぇドラマみてぇだな……とか」=“That walking next to a boy on a beach like this is, straight out of one of those stinky teen dramas... and whatnot.”
「よーよー、マブい女連れてんじゃねーかって絡まれる……みたいなやつ？」=“You mean like one of those "Oh hey, that's one pretty woman you've got there"... type of thing?”
「それのどこが青くせぇドラマ……」=“What part of that sounds like a stinky teen drama...”
「って、バカかよ！　やめろよマブいとか」=“Wuh, dummy! Cut out that "pretty" stuff.”
「[H名]はマブいよ！　俺が不良だったら間違いなくちょっかい出したくなるね」=“You're really pretty though! If I was a delinquent I'd definitely try to make a pass at you.”
「バカ野郎！　私がそんなクソみたいな連中にホイホイついていくと思ってんのか」=“Dumbass! You think I'd just go along like a damsel along with such a pathetic lot?”
「私は決めた男にずっとついていくタイプの、お、女だ……」=“I'm the sort of, w-woman that sticks to the one man she's already set her heart on.”
「って、黙ってんじゃねぇよ！　引いてんのか」=“Wuh, don't just get quiet like that! What, you put off by that?”
「まさか、逆だよ。[H名]がそんなに俺のこと想ってくれてるなんて嬉しいなぁって思っただけ」=“As if, it's the opposite if anything. It just made me really happy to know that you really think of me just that much, [H名].”
「……当たり前のこといちいち言うな」=“...Don't bring up such obvious things again and again.”
「ったく、暑くなっちまっただろ！　もうちょっと歩こうぜ」=“Jeez, now I feel all hot! Let's walk a bit more.”
「あはは。もちろん、どこまででも付き合うよ」=“Ahahah, of course. However much you want.”
