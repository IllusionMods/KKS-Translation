「かなり気持ち良かったぜ。お前、オイル塗るの上手いな」=“That felt pretty good. You're a good oiler.”
「いい感じだったぜ。綺麗に塗ってくれてありがとな」=“It looked good. Thank you for painting it so nicely.”
「こんなもんかな……普通に気持ち良かったぜ」=“It's not supposed to be like this. ...... It just felt good.”
「どうしたんだ？　まだ塗ってないだろ？　オイル切れてるのか？」=“What's wrong with you?　You haven't applied it yet.　Are you out of oil?”
