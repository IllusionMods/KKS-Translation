「シーサー作りか……こういう工作的なのってあんま得意じゃねぇんだよな」=“Making a shisa, ...... I'm not really good at this kind of craft.”
「粘土で形を作って色を塗るだけだから、そんなに難しくないと思うけど」=“I haven't made anything out of clay since I was a kid. - It's not that hard. You just make a shape out of clay and paint it.”
「うーん……まあ、そうだな。うだうだ言っててもしかたねぇし、作り始めるか！」=“Hmmm ...... well, you're right. I'm not sure what to do with it, but I'm going to start making it.”
「もし出来ない所があったら俺も手伝うよ」=“If there's anything I can't do, I'll help you.”
「おう、助かるぜ！」=“Oh, thank you!”
