「色んな魚がいるね。いすぎてどこ見ていいかわかんないや」=“There are so many different kinds of fish. There are so many fish, I don't know where to look.”
「お、おう、そうな」=“Oh, yeah.”
「[H名]もちゃんと見てる？　なんかそわそわしてるよね」=“Are you even looking at [H名]?　You seem to be fidgeting a bit.”
「見てるよ！　見てるけど……ああ、認めてやるよ。落ち着かねぇなとは思ってる」=“I'm looking!　I'm watching. ...... Oh, I'll admit it. I'll admit, I'm a little restless.”
「水族館なんかデートのド定番って感じでよ……あ、違うぞ？　それが嫌とか楽しくないとか言いたいわけじゃなくて」=“I've always wanted to go on a date with you at an aquarium.　I'm not trying to say that I don't like it or that I don't enjoy it.”
「うんうん、それが恋だよ。恋人同士としての実感ってやつだ」=“Yeah, that's what love is. That's what it's like to be in love. That's what it's like to be a lover.”
「はああ？　てめぇ調子に……いや、でも、そうなのかも」=“What?　It's really cool and the breeze feels really nice!”
「そういうの全部ひっくるめて楽しもうよ」=“Let's just take it all in and enjoy it.”
「そ、そういうもんか、わかったけどよ」=“Yeah, I get it. I get it.”
「けど？」=“But?”
「お前、水族館には詳しいんだろうな？　私はこういうチャラついたところはだいたい全部初めてだからよ」=“You know a lot about aquariums, don't you?　Because I'm new to most of these flirtatious places.”
「了解、エスコートするよ」=“Okay, I'll escort you.”
「……変なことになっちまったよな。私が男に頼るとか」=“It's ...... weird, isn't it? Like, I'm going to need a guy.”
「あ、向こうにマナティーいるらしいよ？　行ってみようか」=“Oh, I heard there are manatees over there.　Shall we go there?”
「マナティーってなんだ？」=“What's a manatee?”
「行けばわかるよ。ほら、エスコートってことで」=“You'll see. I'm your escort.”
「へっ、調子くれやがって。マナティーがどれほどのみんか見てやろうじゃねぇか」=“Heck, you're giving me a hard time. Let's see how good you are at manatee.”
「マナティーにメンチ切るのやめてね」=“Stop macing the manatee.”
