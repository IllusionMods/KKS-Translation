「なにして遊ぶか悩むね。ビーチバレーか、それともビーチフラッグか……」=“I'm wondering what we should do for fun. Beach volleyball or beach flags? ......”
「へ？　その二択なんですか？　後者は勝ち目がないので遠慮したいです……」=“Huh?　You have to choose between the two?　I'd rather not do the latter, because I don't think I can win. ......”
「いや冗談だよ。でもこんな綺麗な海があると、何をして遊ぶか迷うよね」=“I'm just kidding. But with such a beautiful ocean, it's hard to decide what to do with it.”
「泳ぐのも、浜辺でゆっくりするのも楽しいし」=“I'm a good swimmer. I enjoy swimming and relaxing on the beach.”
「ふふ、そうですね。ちょっと贅沢な悩みです」=“Hmm, yes. It's a bit of a luxury problem.”
