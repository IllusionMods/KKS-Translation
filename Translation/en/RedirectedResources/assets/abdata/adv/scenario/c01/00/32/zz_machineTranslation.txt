「景色の良い場所は、デートの定番だと聞いたことがあります」=“I've heard that a place with a nice view is a classic date spot.”
「まあ、そうだね」=“Yeah, I guess so.”
「そんな場所で、一般的なカップルはどの様な会話をするのでしょう？」=“What kind of conversation does a typical couple have in a place like that?”
「うーん、『景色が綺麗だねー』とか、当たり前の感想を二人で共有するだけだと思うよ」=“Hmmm, I think it's just a place where we can share our common thoughts, like 'the scenery is beautiful'.”
「物語なら『君の方が綺麗だ』みたいなキザなことを言うだろうけど」=“If it were a story, I'd say something rude like, 'You're more beautiful than me.”
「……言ってくれないんですか？」=“You're not going to tell me ......?”
「えっ！？　そんなフリ方をされると思わなかった……」=“What?　I didn't know you could pretend like that. ......”
「ふふ、冗談ですよ」=“I'm just kidding.”
