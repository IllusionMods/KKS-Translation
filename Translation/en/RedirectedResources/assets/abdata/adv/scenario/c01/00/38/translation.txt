「なにして遊ぶか悩むね。ビーチバレーか、それともビーチフラッグか……」=“As usual, it's hard to decide what to do, isn't it? Do we play beach volleyball, or maybe beach flags...”
「へ？　その二択なんですか？　後者は勝ち目がないので遠慮したいです……」=“Eh? Do we have just those two options? I'd rather pass on that second one since I will get absolutely decimated...”
「いや冗談だよ。でもこんな綺麗な海があると、何をして遊ぶか迷うよね」=“No, I was just joking. But with a sea this pretty, it really is hard to decide what to do, isn't it?”
「泳ぐのも、浜辺でゆっくりするのも楽しいし」=“Even just swimming around, or walking along the beach would be plenty fun too.”
「ふふ、そうですね。ちょっと贅沢な悩みです」=“Fufuh, indeed. We really are spoilt for choice.”
