「カップルドリンクがあるんだって。二人で飲んでみようよ」=“Apparently they serve a couples' drink here. Let's drink it together.”
「どうだった？　一口飲んだ感想は？」=“How was that? You like it?”
「トロピカルな味がしました」=“It was quite the tropical taste.”
「いや……味じゃなくて、二人で飲んだ感想を聞きたいかな」=“No... I wasn't talking about the taste, I wanted to how you liked drinking it together like that.”
「二人で飲むと……飲み物が減る速度が二倍になりました」=“The contents... disappeared twice as fast as they would have normally.”
「う、うん……そうだね。二人で飲んでるからね……」=“Y-Yeah... that it did. Since we were drinking it together...”
「いいえ、私はあまり飲めませんでしたから、あなたがたくさん飲んだだけです」=“No, I did not drink all that much of it so, you simply drank a lot of it.”
「え……俺そんなに飲んだかな？　ていうか、[H名]はあんまり飲んでなかったの？」=“Eh... did I drink that much? Heck, you didn't drink much of it, [H]?”
「はい……胸が少し詰まる感じがして、上手く飲めませんでした」=“Yes... my chest felt a bit heavy, so I could not drink it properly.”
「それって……もしかしてドキドキしてたってこと？」=“Does that... mean that your heart was pounding?”
「そうですね……おそらくはそのような状態だったかと」=“That's a good question... in all likelihood, yes.”
「ならよかった。ずっと無表情で飲んでたから、不味かったのかなって心配してたんだ」=“That's good then. You had this really blank expression the whole time so, I was worried that maybe it was a bad idea.”
「無表情なのは地です。それはあなたも分かっているはずでは？」=“My expression has no bearing on what I feel. Surely you ought to understand that as well?”
「まぁ、分かってたけど……カップルドリンクとか、ちょっとはしゃぎ過ぎたかなぁと思って……」=“Well, I do know that but... I was wondering if I went a bit too overboard, suggesting a couples' drink of all things...”
「私は……嬉しかったですよ。でも恥ずかしくもあったので……嬉し恥ずかし……です」=“It... made me happy. However, it made me quite embarrassed as well... so I'm quite... embarrassed-happy right now.”
「はは、そっか。[H名]に二つも感想をもらえたなら、勇気を出して飲んでよかったかな」=“Hahah, I see. If it made you feel two emotions at the same time, then I guess it was worth pushing through and ordering it.”
「勇気……？」=“Pushing through...?”
「俺も実は恥ずかしかったってこと。[H名]と同じだよ、嬉し恥ずかしってやつだった」=“I was also embarrassed, you know. I felt the same embarrassed-happy feeling that you're feeling right now.”
「ん……おそろいですね」=“Nn... how nice, that we didn't differ.”
「あ、今笑った？」=“Ah, did you just smile there?”
「どうでしょう？　もう一度飲めば……同じ表情を再現することは可能かもしれません」=“Who's to say? If we drink it one more time... perhaps you'll get to see that expression again.”
「よし、じゃあもう一回飲もう！　まだドリンクは残ってるしね」=“Alright, let's go for another gulp then! We've still got some of the drink left, afterall.”
