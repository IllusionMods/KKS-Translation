「こういったホテルでの食事って、恋人同士が将来を誓い合うシーンとかよくあるよね」=“Meals at hotels like these, kinda form a backdrop to scenes where couples propose and promise themselves to each other, don't they?”

「だよね、気軽に言えるものじゃないしね……その時まで待っててもらえるかな？」=“Of course, it's not something to be said so lightly either... will you wait for me, until that time?”
「はい、勿論です」=“Yes, of course.”
