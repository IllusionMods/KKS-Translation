「ほほぉ、大盤振る舞いですなぁ……全部美容オイルなのかな」=“Wow, that's a lot of money. ...... I wonder if it's all beauty oil.”
「そうみたい。せっかくだし塗ってあげるよ」=“I guess so. Since you're here, I'll apply it.”
「いいの？　なんだか悪い気がするなぁ」=“You sure?　I don't feel good about it.”
「気にしない、気にしない。俺に任せといて」=“I don't care, I don't care. I'll take care of it.”
