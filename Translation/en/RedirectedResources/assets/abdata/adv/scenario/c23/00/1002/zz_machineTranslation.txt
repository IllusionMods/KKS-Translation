「良いところに卓球台があるね。ちょっとやっていこうか？」=“There's a ping-pong table in a nice spot. Shall we have a go?”
「さあ、一勝負……っていきたいけど、ずいぶんと堂に入った構えだね？」=“Now, I'd like to play a game of ......, but you've got a lot of class, don't you?”
「ふっふっふ、ようやく気付いたようだね」=“Hmmm, I see you've finally noticed.”
「卓球漫画を読み込んだ今のワタシは、いわばラバーの魔術士！」=“I've read so many ping-pong comics, I'm like a rubber wizard!”
「今なら魔球だって打てる気がするのさぁ！」=“I feel like I could hit a magic ball right now!”
「いやいや、漫画を読み込んだだけで魔球なんて打てたら苦労しないよ」=“No, no, no. If you could hit a magic ball just by reading a comic book, you'd have no trouble.”
「ちなみに、実際にプレイした経験は？」=“By the way, have you ever actually played one?”
「ヒミツですぞ！」=“It's a secret!”
「あーうん、なんとなくオチが読めたよ。たいして経験はないんだね？」=“Oh, yeah, I see where you're going with this. You don't have much experience, do you?”
「でも……まぁ、別にいいか。この勝負、受けて立つ！」=“But ...... well, it doesn't matter. I'll take this match!”
「それでこそ、我が恋人にして好敵手。いざ、尋常に勝負！」=“That's my lover and my opponent. Let's play this game!”
「行くぞ、疾風迅雷、炎の――」=“Let's go, wind, thunder, fire...”
「……何か、言うことはある？」=“...... Do you have anything to say?”
「こんなはずじゃないのにぃぃ……！」=“I'm not supposed to be like this. ......!”
