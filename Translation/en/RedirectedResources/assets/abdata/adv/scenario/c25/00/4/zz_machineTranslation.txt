「わ、私とっすか？　い、いきなりっすね～……」=“Wow, with me?　Oh, that's sudden. ......”
「いきなりじゃないよ……ずっときみとＨしたかったんだ」=“It's not out of the blue. ...... I've always wanted to have sex with you.”
「ずっとっすか……それはそれで……でも、キミが相手なら、嫌じゃないかな～……」=“Always? ...... That's one thing. ...... But if it's you, I don't think you'll like it. ......”
「……ＯＫなの？」=“...... Is it OK?”
「恥ずかしいけど、いいっすよ～……その代わり、ちゃんと優しくしてね～……」=“I'm embarrassed, but it's okay. ...... Be nice to me, though. ......”
