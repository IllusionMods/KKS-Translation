「それじゃ、オイルを塗ってあげるからね」=“I'm going to put some oil on you, okay?”
「嬉しいっすね～……いっその事、前も塗ってもらおうかな～」=“I'm so happy. ...... Maybe I'll just have you paint my front too.”
「前って、体の前の方もって事？」=“By front, do you mean the front part of your body?”
「そうっすよ～……できれば、上手に塗って欲しいな～」=“That's right. ...... If possible, I'd like it to be well painted.”
「よし、頑張って上手に塗るよ」=“All right, I'll do my best to paint it well.”
