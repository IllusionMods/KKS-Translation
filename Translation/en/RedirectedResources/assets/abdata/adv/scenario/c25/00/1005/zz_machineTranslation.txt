「キャンプファイヤーだって。参加してみようか」=“It's a campfire. Let's join in.”
「……何事も経験しないとかね～」=“You have to go through ...... everything.”
「…………ほほー」=“............ Whoa.”
「それは何に納得してるの？」=“What are you convinced of?”
「これがキャンプファイヤーかー、みたいな感じ～？」=“This is what a campfire looks like.”
「他人事？」=“Is it someone else?”
「……もちろん、これは私の主観で言ってるんだけど～」=“...... Of course, this is my own subjective opinion~”
「ここにいる私が私じゃないみたいだな～、っていうのは思っちゃってるかも」=“I think [name] is the only person here who's worried about that. I feel like I don't belong here.”
「柄じゃないからね～、こういうの」=“It's not my style, you know.”
「そこまで[H名]が浮世離れしてるイメージないんだけど……」=“I don't think [H名] is that much of a floater...”
「そりゃ、至って普通の人間なんだから。ノリを周りにあわせるくらいはできるけど～」=“I'm just a normal human being, you know. I'm just a normal human being. I can get along with others.”
「そうじゃなくて、うーん……伝わらないかなぁ～」=“No, it's not. I don't know if you'll understand .......”
「……輪の中からの景色はこんな感じか～、みたいなの？」=“...... Is this what the view from inside the circle looks like?”
「彼氏さんと手を繋いでキャンプファイヤーの輪に入る、なんてことはノリを周りにあわせるだけじゃできない体験だからさ～」=“Holding hands with your boyfriend and joining a campfire circle is an experience you can't have if you're just going along with the crowd.”
「今は新鮮でも、そのうちこんなの当たり前になっちゃうよ。俺達こういうのどんどん体験するんだから」=“It may be fresh now, but it will be commonplace soon. It may be new to you now, but it will become commonplace soon enough.”
「あんまり前向きすぎること言われるとダルくなっちゃう～」=“If you say anything too positive, it'll make me dull.”
「またそうやって。当分は[H名]の手を引くのが俺の役割になりそうかな」=“You do that again. I guess it's going to be my role to keep [H名]'s hand off for the time being.”
「お手やわらかにね～」=“Be gentle with your hands.”
