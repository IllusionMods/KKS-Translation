「マングローブにカヤックか～……。ええねぇ、南国ならではって感じやね～」=“Kayaking in the mangroves~....... I guess it's a tropical island, isn't it?”
「うん、楽しそうだね。それじゃ早速乗ろう！」=“'Yeah, that sounds like fun. Let's get on it then!”
「まあ、待ちーや。その前に大事なこと決めんと……前がええ？　後ろがええ？」=“Well, wait a minute. Before that, I have to make an important decision.　Backwards, yes?”
「……それって、いやらしい意味じゃないよね？」=“...... that doesn't mean anything lewd, does it?”
「わかってるくーせーにー。で、どっちがええ？　文句あるなら問答無用で前に乗ってもらうで」=“I know what I'm talking about. So, which is better?　If you have a problem with me, I'll let you ride in front of me, no questions asked.”
「まあ、それでも全然構わないけど」=“Well, that's perfectly all right.”
