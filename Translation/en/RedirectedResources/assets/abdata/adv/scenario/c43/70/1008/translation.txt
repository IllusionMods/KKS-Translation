「わぁ、光ってる光ってる！　綺麗だねー」=“Wah~, they're glowing, they're glowing! So beautiful, isn't it?”
「ホンマや……これが海ほたるか～。結構ガッツリ明るいやん。何ワットぐらいあんねやろ？」=“For real... so these are sea fireflies, huh~? They're glowin' pretty bright, aren't they? How many watts do ya think they are?”
「どうだろうね？　蛍光灯代わりに使うにはキツいかも……でも、最高のイルミネーションだと思うよ」=“Who knows? Not sure you could replace a good old CFL with these... but there's no beating them as far as decorative lighting goes, that's for sure.”
「せやな……めっちゃ綺麗や。持って帰って、玄関の扉に飾って、近所のおっさんビックリさせたいなぁ」=“Yeah... it's super beautiful. I wanna take them home with me and light up our doorway with it, ya know, to give the old farts there a nice shock.”
「持って帰れたとしても飼育できるのかなぁ？」=“Could you really raise them at home though~?”
「……んーまあ、でも、連れて帰るんも可哀想や。部屋で飼って、可愛がりたいけど……まあ、今回は堪忍しとったろ」=“...Nn, point~. But, I'd feel bad takin' them away anyway. I wanna just keep them for myself, and dote on them but... well, just this one, I'll let it go--”
「波間で揺れてるだけだから、ペットには向かないだろうね……残念だけど」=“They're being carried along by the tide so, they probably won't make for great pets... shame too.”
「いやいや、ええねんって。ウチには身近に可愛いのん、おるからな」=“No no, it's fine. There's somethin' else I've been findin' cute lately anyway.”
「え？　そうなの？　ペット飼ってるの？　犬？　猫？　写真持ってる？　見せて？　ねえねえ見せて？」=“Eh? Really? You've got a pet? Is it a dog? A cat? Got a photo? Can I see it? C'mon, can I see it?”
「おお～～、怒涛のハテナマークやな……。まあ、犬っぽいし、猫っぽいとこもあるねんけどな」=“Ooh~, ain't that a whole tide of questions... well, it's kinda like a dog, and kinda like a cat too.”
「ええー？　何なんだろ……。ひょっとして哺乳類じゃないとか……？　有袋類とか、鼻行類の可能性も……」=“Eeh~? I wonder what it is... Is it not a mammal, by any chance...? Maybe it's a marsupial, or perhaps a...”
「あー、うんうん、せやねん。なんかウチの子ぉ見て、博物学者が仰天しよってなぁ…………」=“Ah~, yepyep, exactly. A single look at my boy would be all a nature scientist would need to get the shock of their lives~...”
「って、ええボケしよるや～ん。さすが、ウチの相方やなぁ……」=“Heh, ya got a good gag goin' there. You really, are my man~...”
「あはは、そんなに褒めたら照れるって。で？　何飼ってるの？」=“Ahahah, I'm gonna blush if you praise me so much. So then, what is it exactly that you're keeping as a pet?”
「飼うとるわけやないねんけどな…………まあ、自分のこっちゃ」=“I'm not keepin' anythin' as a pet or anythin'... It's well, I meant you.”
「へ？　自分って……俺？」=“Heh? Me as in... me?”
「そうそう。自分が周りにおってくれるから、寂しないなーってことやねん」=“Exactly. I meant since yer always around me, I don't ever feel lonely, and all.”
「あははっ。うん、そうだね。俺も寂しくなさそうだ！」=“Ahahah--. Yeah, I'll bet. Me neither, you know!”
「………………ってかさぁ…………あー……いや、ええわ……気にせんとって」=“...Heck~... ah~... no, it's fine... don't mind it.”
「どうしたの？」=“What's wrong?”
「せやから……えー、その……海ほたる、めっさ綺麗やなーって……」=“As I was sayin'... eh~, uhm... the sea fireflies, sure are pretty and all...”
「うん、綺麗だね。で、何を言いたかったの？」=“Yep, they sure are. So, what did you actually wanna say?”
「それはー……そのー……海ほたるを使ったモノボケをやなぁ――」=“That's~... uhm~... I was thinkin' of a physical gag to do with them, ya know~---”
「……違うでしょ？　そうやって冗談で茶化すの、よくないよ」=“...You sure? It's not good to hide the truth with jokes, you know?”
「うう、厳しいこと言うやん？　グゥの音も出ーへん……」=“Uuu, ain'tcha bein' pretty harsh? I'm even groanin' here~...”
「グゥ……あ、出たわ！　ビックリした！　ホンマにグゥって音、出よったわ……」=“*Groan*... ah, I really did groan! I didn't expect that! I really did, end up groanin'...”
「って、だからぁ、悪いクセ出てる！　今日はもう、冗談で真面目な話から逃げるの、禁止ね」=“I told you~, your bad habit's coming out! No more running from the truth with jokes today, okay? You're banned.”
「……明日やったらエエんか……？　ま、まあそれはエエねん……わ、わかった。ほいじゃ、その……えーっと……」=“...So yer fine with me doin' it tomorrow...? W-Well, that aside... g-got it. Well then, uhm... erhm~...”
「つ、つまりやな…………こ、この島の旅行が終わっても、ウチ……自分の相方でええのんかなーって……」=“S-So basically... I-I was wonderin' if it'd really be okay, for me to... keep bein' yours even after we get off the island...”
「うん。相方だよ。ずーっと」=“Yep. You'll be mine. Forever.”
「お、おお、マジか。めっちゃ食い気味の返事やん……で、でも嬉しい返事やわ……うん……それやったらええねん」=“O-Ooh, for real? Ya said it really flippantly though... b-but well it does make me happy... yeah... I'd be happy with that.”
「……もう、肝心なところで奥手なんだから」=“...Seriously, you spend way too much time on stuff like these.”
「誰しも欠点はあるねんて。あんまり言わんとってあげて。可哀想やし……」=“Everyone's got their flaws. Don't poke at mine so much. I'm like pitiful and stuff...”
「よ～～し、ほな、これからガンガン海ほたる見物しよか！　めちゃんこ見まくったるで～～……ぐへへへへ……」=“Aight~~, c'mon, we're gonna sightsee the shit outta these sea fireflies! I'mma stare holes into them~~... guheheheheh...”
（また照れ隠ししてる……そういうところ、可愛いんだよなぁ……）=(She's trying to hide her embarrassment again... that side of her is, seriously so cute...)
