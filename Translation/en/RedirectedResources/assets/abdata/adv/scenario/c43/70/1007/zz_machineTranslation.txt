「うわー、めっちゃ綺麗やん！　この窓。デカいし、透明やし」='Wow, it's so beautiful!　This window. It's huge and transparent."
「注目するの、そこ！？」=“You're paying attention to that?”
「あ、ごめんごめん。ついうっかり……」=I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just accidentally ......"
「いや、うっかりって返しもよくわかんないけど……まあ、それにしても、立派で、綺麗な水族館だね」=“No, I don't know what you mean by "inadvertently." ...... Well, it's a fine, beautiful aquarium, by the way.”
「うん、マジで綺麗やな～。色とりどりのサンゴ礁に、原色バリバリの小魚の群れ……」=“Yeah, it's really beautiful. Colorful coral reefs and schools of small fish in primary colors. ......”
「めっちゃ可愛いなぁ。この近海の海中も、こんな感じなんやろうけど……」=“It's so cute. I guess this is what it's like in the ocean around here, too. ......”
「まあ、それなら素潜りでもすれば良さそうだけどね」=“Well, that sounds like a good idea if you're going to bare dive.”
「いやぁ、息、そないに続かへんやん？　ウチ、落ち着いた状態でジックリ見たいわ。お茶でも飲みながら」=“No, you can't hold your breath that long, can you?　I'd like to see it in a calm and relaxed state. Let's have a cup of tea.”
「……この水族館、飲食禁止っぽいけどね」=“...... seems like no food or drink is allowed in this aquarium, though.”
「マジかー……非常時には、ここの魚、釣って食うたろ思てたのにな～」=“I thought I'd catch and eat the fish here in case of an emergency.”
「さっき、めっちゃ可愛いって言ってたのに？」=“You said she was really cute earlier.”
「うん、せやから非常時には陥らへんようにしたいもんやで」=“Yeah, and we don't want to fall into an emergency situation.”
「……けど、なんやろな。この底知れぬシーフードへの誘惑は。水族館の中に、寿司屋作ったら、めっちゃ繁盛しそうやな」=“I'm not sure what it is, though. This unfathomable temptation to seafood. If they built a sushi restaurant inside the aquarium, it would be very prosperous.”
「そ、そうかなぁ……動物園の横に焼肉屋があったら、繁盛すると思う？」=Well, do you think ...... if there was a barbecue restaurant next to the zoo, it would thrive?"
「どうやろ……？　まあまあイケそうな気ぃするけどなぁ」=“What do you think ......?　I think it's going to be okay.”
「……ま、まあ、ともかく。ゆっくりと館内を見て回ろう」=“......Well, anyway. Let's take our time and look around.”
