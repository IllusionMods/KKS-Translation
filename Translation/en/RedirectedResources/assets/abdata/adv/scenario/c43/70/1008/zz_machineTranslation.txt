「わぁ、光ってる光ってる！　綺麗だねー」=“Wow, it's glowing, glowing, glowing!　It's beautiful.”
「ホンマや……これが海ほたるか～。結構ガッツリ明るいやん。何ワットぐらいあんねやろ？」=“I'm sure you're right. ...... This is Umihotaru, isn't it? It's pretty bright, isn't it? How many watts is it?”
「どうだろうね？　蛍光灯代わりに使うにはキツいかも……でも、最高のイルミネーションだと思うよ」=“What do you think?　Maybe it's too tight to use in place of fluorescent lighting ......, but I think it's the best illumination we have.”
「せやな……めっちゃ綺麗や。持って帰って、玄関の扉に飾って、近所のおっさんビックリさせたいなぁ」=“I know. ...... is so beautiful. I want to take it home and hang it on my front door to surprise the old man in the neighborhood.”
「持って帰れたとしても飼育できるのかなぁ？」=“Even if I could bring it home, I wonder if I could keep it?”
「……んーまあ、でも、連れて帰るんも可哀想や。部屋で飼って、可愛がりたいけど……まあ、今回は堪忍しとったろ」=“I'm not sure I want to take him home with me. I'd like to keep him in my room and take care of him, but ...... well, I guess I'll just have to bear it this time.”
「波間で揺れてるだけだから、ペットには向かないだろうね……残念だけど」=“It's just swaying between the waves, so it wouldn't make a good pet for me ...... unfortunately.”
「いやいや、ええねんって。ウチには身近に可愛いのん、おるからな」=“No, no, no, it's fine. We have a cute one close to us.”
「え？　そうなの？　ペット飼ってるの？　犬？　猫？　写真持ってる？　見せて？　ねえねえ見せて？」=“What?　Really?　Do you have a pet?　Dogs?　Cats?　Do you have a picture?　Can I see it?　Hey, hey, let me see?”
「おお～～、怒涛のハテナマークやな……。まあ、犬っぽいし、猫っぽいとこもあるねんけどな」=“Ohhhh, you're a raging hatter, aren't you ....... Well, I'm dog-like and cat-like at the same time.”
「ええー？　何なんだろ……。ひょっとして哺乳類じゃないとか……？　有袋類とか、鼻行類の可能性も……」=“Eh?　I wonder what it is. ...... Not a mammal by any chance or ......?　It could be a marsupial or a proboscidean. ......”
「あー、うんうん、せやねん。なんかウチの子ぉ見て、博物学者が仰天しよってなぁ…………」=“Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think the naturalist was aghast when he saw my son. ............”
「って、ええボケしよるや～ん。さすが、ウチの相方やなぁ……」=“You've got a great sense of humor, don't you? That's my partner. ......”
「あはは、そんなに褒めたら照れるって。で？　何飼ってるの？」=“Haha, he's embarrassed if I compliment him that much. So?　What do you have?”
「飼うとるわけやないねんけどな…………まあ、自分のこっちゃ」=“I don't have a pet, though. ............ Well, it's my own thing.”
「へ？　自分って……俺？」=“Huh?　Do you consider yourself to be ...... me?”
「そうそう。自分が周りにおってくれるから、寂しないなーってことやねん」=“Yes, yes. I'll never be lonely because I'll be around you.”
「あははっ。うん、そうだね。俺も寂しくなさそうだ！」=“Hahaha. Yeah, that's right. Looks like I won't be lonely either!”
「………………ってかさぁ…………あー……いや、ええわ……気にせんとって」=“I mean, ..................... ......... ...uh ...... no, yeah, never mind ......”
「せやから……えー、その……海ほたる、めっさ綺麗やなーって……」=“So ...... well, that ...... sea firefly, it's so beautiful. ......”
「うん、綺麗だね。で、何を言いたかったの？」=“Yes, it's beautiful. So, what did you want to say?”
「それはー……そのー……海ほたるを使ったモノボケをやなぁ――」=“It's a ...... monoboke using the ...... sea fireflies...”
「……違うでしょ？　そうやって冗談で茶化すの、よくないよ」=“You said, ...... not right?　It's not nice to joke around like that.”
「うう、厳しいこと言うやん？　グゥの音も出ーへん……」=“Ugh, that's a harsh thing to say, isn't it?　I can't even make a guffaw. ......”
「グゥ……あ、出たわ！　ビックリした！　ホンマにグゥって音、出よったわ……」=“Guu...... oh, there it is!　You scared me!　I really heard a guu sound. ......”
「って、だからぁ、悪いクセ出てる！　今日はもう、冗談で真面目な話から逃げるの、禁止ね」=“I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.　No more joking around and running away from serious topics today.”
「……明日やったらエエんか……？　ま、まあそれはエエねん……わ、わかった。ほいじゃ、その……えーっと……」=“...... if I do it tomorrow, ......?　Well, well, that's okay. ...... Okay, okay. Okay, well, let's see ......, let's see .........”
「つ、つまりやな…………こ、この島の旅行が終わっても、ウチ……自分の相方でええのんかなーって……」=“Well, I mean, ............ I'm not sure if I'll be able to use my ...... own partner after this trip to the island is over. ......”
「うん。相方だよ。ずーっと」=“I'm not sure what you mean by that. We're partners. Always.”
「お、おお、マジか。めっちゃ食い気味の返事やん……で、でも嬉しい返事やわ……うん……それやったらええねん」=“Oh, oh, really? That's a pretty biting reply ......, but I'm glad you responded ...... yeah ...... that'd be good.”
「……もう、肝心なところで奥手なんだから」=“......, you're so deep down to the point of no return.”
「誰しも欠点はあるねんて。あんまり言わんとってあげて。可哀想やし……」=“Everyone has flaws, you know. Don't say too much. I feel sorry for him. ......”
「よ～～し、ほな、これからガンガン海ほたる見物しよか！　めちゃんこ見まくったるで～～……ぐへへへへ……」=“Alright, let's go see Umihotaru now!　I'm going to look around so much~~......Ghehehehehehe ......”
（また照れ隠ししてる……そういうところ、可愛いんだよなぁ……）=(He's being shy again. ...... That's what's so cute about him. ......)
