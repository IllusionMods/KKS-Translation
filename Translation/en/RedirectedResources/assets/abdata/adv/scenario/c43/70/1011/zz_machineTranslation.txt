「うわ～～……エゲツないぐらい綺麗やん……世の中、こないにオシャンティーな世界がウチと同じ地平に存在しててんなぁ」=“I can't believe how beautiful ...... it is...how the world exists on the same level as ours.”
「うん、完全にお金持ちの世界だね……」=“Yeah, it's totally a rich man's world. ......”
「それにしても、こんなところに泊まれたり住めたりする人は、前世でどんだけ功徳を積んだんやろね」=“I wonder, though, how much merit and virtue must a person have accumulated in a previous life to be able to stay and live in a place like this?”
「お金持ちって輪廻転生してるの……？　まあ、ともかく、こういう暮らしが出来る人間に生まれたかったなぁ……」=“'Do rich people reincarnate ......?　Well, anyway, I wish I'd been born someone who could live like this. ......”
「……せやなぁ。ちゅうても今の暮らしに、不満はぜーんぜんあらへんねんけどね」=“I think it's a good idea to have a website like ....... I'm not at all dissatisfied with the life I have now, though.”
「うん、実は俺も。けど、ときどき贅沢するぐらいの余裕は欲しいかなー」=“Yeah, me too, actually. But I would like to be able to afford to splurge from time to time.”
「心の洗濯はめっちゃ大事やもんなぁ……うわー、めっちゃ綺麗やなぁ、ほんま……」=“Washing your mind is so important. ...... Wow, it's so beautiful, really. ......”
「だねー。せっかくだし、プールの方にも行ってみようか」=“I guess so. Since we're here, let's go to the pool.”
「……最高やな、ここ。でも……ウチ、この部屋に住むん、多分無理やわ。金銭的な意味やなくてな」=“I love ......, this place is great. But ...... we probably won't be able to live in this room. And I don't mean financially.”
「どうして？　こんなにいいところなのに」=“Why?　It's such a nice place.”
「いやっ、掃除の労力、エグいやん！　プール掃除とかウチやったことないし！」=“No, the cleaning effort is too much!　I've never cleaned a pool or anything like that!”
「んで、さっきまでおったリビング！　ひっろいひっろいでぇ。奥の方に地平線、ちょっと見えたからね。マジで」=“So, the living room where you were just now!　It's a great big one. I could see the horizon in the back, just a little bit. Seriously.”
「いや、普通に壁だったけど……」=“No, it was just a regular wall. ......”
「……まあ、地平線はウソやけどさぁ、なんにせよ広すぎやで。部屋ん中で、鹿が飼えそうやし」=“I'm not sure if I'm lying about the horizon, but whatever it is, it's too big. I could have a deer in my room.”
「なんで鹿なの……？　まあ、とにかく、住むには広すぎだね。たしかに……」=“'Why the deer ......?　Well, too big to live in anyway. Indeed. ......”
「せやから、やっぱ時々遊びにくるぐらいにとどめといた方がええと思うんやわ」=“So I think it's best if you just come by once in a while.”
「そうだね……それは確かに。またここに来れるかなぁ」=“Yes. ...... that's for sure. I wonder if I can come back here again.”
「……この景色、一回チラ見するだけやったら勿体ないわ。ほんま、ええ眺めやわぁ……」=“I'd be ashamed if I only got one glimpse of this view at ......." It's really a nice view. ......”
「うん、最高に綺麗だね。……キミも綺麗だよ、[H名]」=“Yes, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen... you're beautiful too, [H名].”
「ここまで景色綺麗やと、窓ガラスもピッカピカにしとかんとアカン気ぃせえへん？」=“Don't you think the windows need to be shined when the scenery is this beautiful?”
「まさかの無視！？」=“You can't possibly be ignoring me!”
「ここのめっちゃでっかいベッド、見た？　あの上でゴロンゴロンしながら、ぼーっと海を眺めるんは最高やろなぁ」=“Did you see this huge bed here?　It must be great to just sit back, relax, and stare out at the ocean.”
「……うん、そうだね、いずれ経験したいよね」=“......, yeah, I'd love to experience that at some point.”
「よっしゃ、決めたで。いずれ、ウチが世界の支配者になったら、ここに住む！」=“I've made up my mind. When we eventually become the rulers of the world, we will live here!”
「こ、ここに？　世界の支配者なのに……？　もっと立派なところに住めそうだけど……」=“Here? Here?　You're the ruler of the world and you're ......?　I could live in a nicer place. ......”
「で、小型犬飼うねん。大家さんに内緒で」=“I'm going to get a small dog. Don't tell my landlord.”
「ペット不可物件なんだね。で、借家なんだ……それに、鹿を飼うとかどーとか言ってたような……ああ、つっこむ所、多いっ！」=“I see you don't allow pets. And it's a rented house. ...... And I think you said something about having deer. ...... Oh, there are so many places to poke around!”
「あはは、ええ返しや。けど、配偶者が、こういう物件を所有してるっちゅうパターンが、一番現実的かなぁ」=“Haha, yeah, that's a nice comeback. But I think the most realistic pattern is that the spouse owns this kind of property.”
「うーん……たしかに。けど、独身の大金持ち、んで適齢期の人って、そうそう巡り会えないよなぁ……」=“Hmmm......... Indeed. But it's not every day you meet someone single, rich, and of the right age. ......”
「んー……惜しいなぁ。その返し、ちゃうねん…………けど、まあええか～」=“I'm sorry, he said. That's not what I meant ............, but okay...”
