「おお～……結構豪快な音、するねんなぁ。なんかロックを感じひん？」=“Oh~ ...... it's quite a lively sound, isn't it? You feel like you're rocking out?”
「ど、どうかな？　でも、鳴らしてる感じは楽しいね」=“I don't know.　But it's fun to play.”
「なんかさぁ、曲作りたぁなるな。ほら、ウチらのラブラブソングとか」=“It makes me want to write a song. You know, our love love song.”
「……え？　作曲、できるの？」=“I'm going to go to ...... and ask, ...... what?　Can you compose music?”
「いや、全然できへんねんけどな？　でも、なんか、ほら……ノリで出来そうやん？　底しれぬ愛の力で」=“No, I can't do it at all, though, can I?　But, you know what, I think I can do it with a ...... groove, don't you?　The power of unfathomable love.”
「愛の力は偉大だね……まあ、でも、ラブソングは作ってみたいなぁ……いずれ」=“The power of love is great ...... well, but I'd like to write a love song ...... eventually.”
