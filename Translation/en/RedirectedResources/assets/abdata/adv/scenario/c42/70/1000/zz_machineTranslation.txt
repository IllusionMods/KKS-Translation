「カップルドリンクがあるんだね。良かったら、一緒に飲んでみない？」=“I see you have a couple's drink. Would you like to have one with me?”
「えへへ。一口飲んでみたけど、これは恥ずかしいねー。顔がすっごく近くなちゃうし、ドキドキしちゃうよぉ」=“Heh, heh. I tried to take a sip, but this is embarrassing. My face is so close to it, it makes me nervous.”
「キミの顔がドアップで近づいて来て、まつげとか唇とかすっごく近くに見えて……」=“Your face came close to me in a close-up, and I could see your eyelashes and lips very close to mine. ......”
「俺もここまで恥ずかしいとは思わなかったよ」=“I didn't think I'd be this embarrassed either.”
「えへへ。でもさ、これってすっごく恋人してるーって感じがすると思うよ？　キミはどう思う？」=“Heh heh heh. But I think it feels like I'm in love with someone.　What do you think?”
「恋人でもなければこんな風に飲まないしね」=“And if it wasn't for my girlfriend, I wouldn't be drinking like this.”
「そもそもカップルドリンクって名前からしていかにも……だしね」=“And the name of the couple's drink is ...... very ...... to begin with.”
「そうだねー。えへへ、顔がいつもより熱いかもー」=“I guess so. Hehe, my face might be hotter than usual.”
「うーん……でもどうしよう？　まだ一口しか飲んでないし、もっと……飲んじゃう……？」=“'Hmmm ...... but what shall I do?　I've only had a sip and I'm going to drink more ......?”
「[H名]が良ければ、俺はこのまま一緒に飲めればって思うけど……どう？」=“If it's okay with [H名], I think I'd like to keep drinking with her... how about that?”
「うんっ！　恥ずかしいけど、嫌じゃないし……」=“Yeah!　It's embarrassing, but I don't mind. ......”
「なによりキミと一緒のドリンクを飲むっていうのは、ドキドキして好き……かなぁ」=“I think I like the idea of having a drink with you more than anything else because it makes me nervous. ......”
「じゃあ、早速もう一口飲もうか？」=“Well, let's have another sip right away, shall we?”
「えへへ。じゃあ、いっせーので口をつけよ？」=“Heh heh heh. Then, let's have a sip at once, shall we?”
「わかった。それじゃあ……」=“I'm going to go to the airport and see what's going on. Okay then. ......”
「いっせーのーでっ！」=“One, two, three!”
