「新鮮な魚介類は美味しいもんねー。生でもよし、焼いてもよしで、どれを食べるか迷っちゃうよぉ」=“Fresh seafood is delicious, isn't it? You can eat it raw or grilled, it's hard to decide which one to eat.”

「えっ、何それ、ずるい！」=“What? That's not fair!”
「ずるくないもーん。それでどれを注文するの？　ほらほら、早く決めてよー」=“It's not fair. So which ones are you going to order?　Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.”
「ぐぬぬ……ああくそっ、いっそ両方注文してやる……！」=“I'm going to order both ......!”
