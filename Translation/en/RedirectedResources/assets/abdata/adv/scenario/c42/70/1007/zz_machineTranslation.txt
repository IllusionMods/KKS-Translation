「わぁ……！　いろんな魚がいっぱいいるねー！」=“Wow. ......!　There are so many different kinds of fish!”
「種類が多くて、見てて飽きないね」=“There are so many different kinds. I never get tired of looking at them.”
「でも、不思議に思うんだけどさ。同じ水槽内に別の種類の魚を入れるのって大丈夫なのかな？」=“But I wonder. Is it okay to have different species of fish in the same tank?”
「大丈夫ってどういうこと？」=“What do you mean, "okay"?”
「小さい魚とかは大きい魚に食べられちゃいそうでしょ？　さすがに、ある程度は水槽はわけているだろうけど……」=“I mean, you'd think the big fish would eat all the little fish and stuff, wouldn't you?　As you would expect, the tanks will be separated to some extent, but ......”
「そこは、餌をあげてるから大丈夫なんじゃないかなー？　ご飯があったら、ちゃんとそっちを食べるでしょ？」=“I think it's okay there because I'm feeding them.　If there was food, you would eat it, right?”
「それもそうか。水槽の中だと楽して餌を食べられるんだもんね」=“'I see that, too. In an aquarium, you can feed yourself with pleasure.”
「それに、いろんな種類の魚が１つの水槽に入ってる方が、キラキラしてて綺麗だよー？」=“Besides, wouldn't it be more beautiful to have all kinds of fish in one tank, all sparkling?”
「ほら、あそこ！　鮮やかな色の魚がいっぱいいる！」=“Look, there it is!　Lots of brightly colored fish!”
「おお……あれってなんていう魚だろ？　３種類くらいの魚が固まってるのかな？」=“Oh ...... what kind of fish is that?　Is there about three different kinds of fish clumped together?”
「競うようにして泳いでて、すっごく楽しそうだねー」=“You look like you're having a lot of fun swimming competitively.”
「南の島の魚って元々カラフルなのが多いからか、すごいね、これは……」=“Maybe it's because most south island fish are colorful to begin with, but wow, this is .......”
「他の水槽も同じくらい綺麗だったりするのかなー？」=“I wonder if the other tanks are as beautiful?”
「かもしれないね。今度はあっちへ行ってみようか？」=“Maybe. Shall we go that way this time?”
「うんっ。さあ、早く早くー！」=“I'm not sure. Come on, come on, come on!”
