「うーん、なんか違うんだよなぁ……」=“Hmmm, something different about .......”
「あのさ、俺の作ったシーサーが妙に大きい気がして……」=“You know, I think the seersucker I made is strangely large. ......”
「あっ……。う、うん。私の作った奴よりもひとまわりくらい大きいかも……」=“Oh, ....... Uh-huh. It's probably about a size bigger than the one I made. ......”
「やっぱり！　作ってるうちに、どんどん大きくなって来ちゃってさぁ」=“I knew it!　As I was making them, they just kept getting bigger and bigger.”
「あっ、でも、私のと並べたらカップルっぽく見えるんじゃないかな？　ほらほら、どう思うー？」=“But if you put them side by side with mine, they'd look like a couple, wouldn't they?　Here, here, what do you think?”
「……っ！？　そんな風に見えなくもないかも」=“I'm not sure what you mean by ......!　It might even look that way.”
「じゃあ、私のと並べて置いて、夫婦ってことにしようよ！　えへへへ」=“Then let's put them side by side with mine and call ourselves a couple!　Heh heh heh.”
