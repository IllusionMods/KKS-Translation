「さすがお土産屋。どこを見ても、欲しい物ばっかりでつい目移りしてしまうね……」=As one would expect from a souvenir shop. Everywhere I look, there are so many things I want that I can't stop looking. ......
「ねー。ぎっちりといろんなお土産が並んでるもんねー」=Hey," he said. There are all kinds of souvenirs lined up.
「あっ、あれとかキミに良いと思わない？　ちょっと見てみようよー！」="Oh, don't you think that one would be good for you?　Let's take a look!"
「おっ、どれかな？　というか、俺の好みなんて知っててくれてるんだ？」="Whoa, which one?　I mean, do you even know what I like?"
「えへへ、知らない仲じゃないからねっ。ほら、早くー」=Heh heh, we're not strangers. Come on, come on.
「うん。[H名]のおすすめなんだし、ぜひともチェックしておかないとね！」=I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it. It's [H名]'s recommendation, so I'll have to check it out!
