「ねー。ぎっちりといろんなお土産が並んでるもんねー」=“Hey," he said. There are all kinds of souvenirs lined up.”
「あっ、あれとかキミに良いと思わない？　ちょっと見てみようよー！」=“Oh, don't you think that one would be good for you?　Let's take a look!”
「おっ、どれかな？　というか、俺の好みなんて知っててくれてるんだ？」=“Whoa, which one?　I mean, do you even know what I like?”
「えへへ、知らない仲じゃないからねっ。ほら、早くー」=“Heh heh, we're not strangers. Come on, come on.”
「うん。[H名]のおすすめなんだし、ぜひともチェックしておかないとね！」=“I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it. I'll have to check it out since it's [H名]'s recommendation!”
