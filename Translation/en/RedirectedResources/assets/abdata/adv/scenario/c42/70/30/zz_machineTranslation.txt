「あそこにある灯台って、けっこう大きいよね」=“That lighthouse over there is pretty big.”
「そうだねー、灯台の上から見た景色は綺麗なんだろうな～」=“I know...the view from the top of the lighthouse must be beautiful...”
「でも、上まで登るのは大変そうじゃない？」=“But doesn't it seem like a lot of work to climb all the way to the top?”
「あははっ、たしかにそうだよね。私は近くから見上げるだけでいいかも」=“Haha, yes, that's true. I might as well just look up at them from up close.”
「それだけでも、灯台の大きさは充分に感じられるしね」=“It's enough to make the lighthouse feel big enough.”
「うんうん。キミと灯台を見に来られてよかったかなっ」=“I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it. I'm glad I came to see you and the lighthouse.”
