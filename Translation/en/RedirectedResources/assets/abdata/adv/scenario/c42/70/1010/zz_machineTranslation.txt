「ん～、浜辺にいると、風がいっぱい吹いて気持ちいーなー」=“Mmm, it's so nice to be on the beach with the wind blowing.”
「ひと遊びした直後で身体が火照ってるし、なおさら風が気持ちよく感じるよね」=“The breeze feels even better after a night of fun and games.”
「うんっ。やっぱりキミと遊ぶのはすっごく楽しい！　えへへ、ついはしゃいじゃった」=“I'm sorry, I'm not sure. It's so much fun playing with you!　Hehehe, I got so excited.”
「楽しんで貰えたなら、俺もデートをして良かったって思うよ」=“If you enjoyed it, I'm glad I went on the date with you.”
「そういえば、[H名]って子供のときからそんな感じだったのかな？」=“Come to think of it, has [H名] been like that since she was a child?”
「私の子供のときのお話？」=“Stories about when I was a kid?”
「そうそう。子供のときから明るくて、遊ぶ時も思いっきり楽しむ……って性格だったのかな？　って思って」=“Yes, yes. I wonder if he had a bright personality ...... since he was a child and enjoyed himself to the fullest when he played.　I just thought...”
「うーん……どうなんだろ？　自分のことだし、あんまり変わってないと思うけど……」=“'Hmmm ...... what do you think?　It's just me, and I don't think I've changed much. ......”
「あっ、でも、今よりもちょっとだけ大人しい性格だったかも」=“Oh, but maybe he was a little more mature than he is now.”
「へえ、そうなんだ？　今の[H名]を見るとあんまり想像がつかないね……」=“Oh, really?　Looking at [H名] now, I can't imagine much more...”
「でも、それならそれで、今みたいに活発になったきっかけってなんだったのかな？」=“But then, how did you become as active as you are now?”
「えーっとね、昔、近所に仲の良いお姉さんが住んでたんだー」=“Let's see, I used to have a good sister who lived in the neighborhood.”
「お姉さんはいつもニコニコ笑顔で、それがすっごい魅力的で、素敵な人だったの！」=“She always had a smile on her face, and it was so charming, she was such a nice person!”
「へぇ……。それって、今の[H名]みたいな感じだったってこと？」=“He said, Wow... Does that mean she looked like [H名] does now?”
「えへへ。もし、今の私がお姉さんと同じみたいに見えるなら、すっごく嬉しいなー」=“Heh heh heh. If I look like your sister now, I'll be very happy.”
「私、お姉さんのことがすっごく好きで、憧れてたんだもん」=“I like your sister a lot, and I've admired her for a long time.”
「お姉さんは楽しいことを見つけるのが上手でね、いつも私と遊んでくれながら楽しいことを教えてくれてたの」=“She was always good at finding fun things to do, and she was always playing with me and teaching me how to have fun.”
「だから、私もお姉さんと同じように、楽しいことを見つけちゃおう！　って思ってたんだ」=“So, like your sister, I'm going to find something fun to do!　I was thinking...”
「そっか……だから[H名]は、楽しむときも思いっきり全力で……って感じなのか」=“I see...so [H名] is like ... when she's having fun, she's going all out ...”
「そのお姉さんは、[H名]に強い影響を与えているんだね」=“The sister must have been a strong influence on [H名].”
「うん。昔も、今も、私の憧れの人だよっ」=“Yes. He was, and still is, my dream man.”
「それで、[H名]は今はちゃんとお姉さんみたいに楽しめてる？」=“So, is [H名] having as much fun as her sister now?”
「んー……お姉さんみたいに、とはちょっと違うかも」=“Maybe not quite like your sister at .......”
「だって、今はキミと恋人になって、一緒にこうしてデートして……えへへ」=“Because now I'm your girlfriend, and we're dating like this ...... hehe.”
「ただ楽しいだけじゃなくて、すごい幸せも一緒に……それも毎日、バンバンやってきてるんだよ！？」=“It's not just fun, but awesome happiness is coming along with ...... it's coming with a bang, too, every day!”
「だから、昔よりも今の方がずっと、ずーっと充実してるんだー」=“So I'm much, much more content now than I used to be.”
「そ、そっか。そこまで言われると、俺もちょっと照れるな」=“I see. I'm a little embarrassed when you say that.”
「えへへ……大好きだよ。だから毎日、いっぱい楽しいことしようねっ」=“I love you, he said. So let's have lots of fun every day.”
