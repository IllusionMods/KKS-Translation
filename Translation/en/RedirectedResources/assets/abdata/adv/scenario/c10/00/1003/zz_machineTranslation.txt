「お土産を見てみない？　[H名]が気に入りそうなお土産が売られてるかもしれないよ」=“Would you like to see some souvenirs?　Maybe they have some souvenirs for sale that [H名] would like.”
「ククッ、我の眼鏡に適うアイテムなぞ、このような場末のショップに置いてあるわけがない」=“I'll ask you if you'd like to be my servant. - No, you won't find anything that suits my taste in this little store.”
「だが、汝がそこまで言うなら付き合ってやろう。まったくもって時間の無駄だがな」=“But if you insist, I'll go with you. But if you insist, I'll go with you, though it's a complete waste of time.”
「これを見よ！　おかしな文字がプリントされてるＴシャツだぞ。すごく可愛いな！」=“Look at this!　Look at this! It's a T-shirt with funny characters printed on it. It's so cute!”
「おお！　あっちにはいかにも南国的なシャツが！　どれも魅力的だぞ！」=“Oh!　There's a very tropical shirt over there!　They're very attractive!”
「そうだね。気に入ったものはあるかな？」=“Yes, we should. Do you see anything you like?”
「うーむ、魅力的なアイテムがたくさんで、どれを選んだらいいか迷ってしまうなぁ」=“Hmmm, there are so many fascinating items here, it's hard to choose just one.”
「すごい浮かれようだね。[H名]のお眼鏡に適いまくったみたいだ」=“I'm so excited, he said. It seems that [H名]'s eyes have been opened to all kinds of things.”
「はっ！？」=“What?”
「ちちち違うぞっ。別に浮かれていたわけではない。これはただ、場に漂う妖気にあてられただけで……」=“No, no, no, no! I wasn't getting carried away. It's not that I'm not happy, it's just that I was caught up in the spirit of the place. ......”
「あっ！　カッコいいアクセサリーが売られているぞ！　あれはドラゴンがモチーフだと思わないかっ？」=“Oh!　There's some cool accessories for sale!　Don't you think they have a dragon motif?”
「なるほど。陽気という名の妖気にあてられたみたいだ」=“I see. I think I've been bewitched by the specter of cheerfulness.”
