「風の通り道になってるみたいだ。ここでゆっくりしていこうよ」=“It's a breeze. Let's just relax here.”
「ふむ、よい風が吹いておるな」=“Hmm, there's a good wind blowing.”
「でも、この風……少し悲しそうに聞こえるね。ひゅーひゅーってか細い声で鳴いてるよ」=“But this wind ...... sounds a little sad. You sound a little sad. You sound like you're crying.”
「何も悲しくて鳴いているわけではないと思うぞ。嬉しい時も過呼吸になるであろう？」=“I don't think he's crying because he's sad. You hyperventilate when you're happy, don't you?”
「過呼吸？　つまりこの風は興奮してるってこと？」=“Hyperventilating?　Does that mean I'm hyperventilating?”
「その通り。魔界の限定レアグッズを見つけた時や、超時空のゲートが開いた時、悪魔なら喜びむせぶものだ」=“Exactly. A demon would be overjoyed when he finds a limited edition rare item in the demon world or when he opens a gate in space-time.”
「この風は鬼門より吹いておる。おそらく、興奮した悪魔が息を乱しておるのだ。故に生ぬるい……」=“This wind is coming from the demon's gate. This wind is blowing from the demon's gate, probably because an excited demon is disturbing his breath. So it's lukewarm. ......”
「えぇ……悪魔の吐息って生ぬるいんだ。何か嫌だなぁ」=“Yeah, ...... devil's breath is lukewarm. I don't like it.”
「悪魔が人に媚びへつらってどうする！　嫌なことを進んで行うのが悪魔だぞ！」=“What's a demon doing flirting with people?　What's a demon doing flirting with people? A demon is willing to do things it doesn't like!”
「だったら、[H名]も人が嫌がることをするの？」=“So, does [H名] do things that people don't like?”
「その通り。心苦しいが魂に刻まれし宿命故に、反故には出来ぬ」=“You're right. It pains me to say it, but it's a destiny that's engraved in my soul and I can't violate it.”
「ククッ、さっそく意地悪をしてやろうか？　悪魔的な吐息を汝にも吹きかけてやる」=“Shall I be nasty to thee?　I'm going to breathe my demonic breath on you.”
「我の生ぬるいデーモンブレスを喰らうがいい。汝と共に時を過ごせる喜びに、今日も呼吸が荒くなっておるぞ」=“If I'm not mistaken, you can find me at  for sex. My breath is ragged today from the pleasure of spending time with you.”
「あはは。なるほどね。確かにいつも息が荒いもんね」=“Haha. I see. You're right, he's always breathing hard.”
「[H名]の吐息ならドンと来いだよ。そのままキスしちゃおうかな？」=“[H名]'s breath is a big hit with me. I could just kiss her like that.”
「んなぁ……っ！？　ば、ばかぁ。調子に乗るな！」=“I don't like your honesty about your desires.　Don't get carried away! Don't get carried away!”
「そういうのはその……しっかりと心の準備をした後で頼む……」=“I'm telling you, that's not a character! - That's the ...... thing to do after you've prepared yourself well.”
「あ、う、うん。そのときはどうぞよろしくお願いします……」=“Oh, uh-huh. Please let me know when you do. ......”
