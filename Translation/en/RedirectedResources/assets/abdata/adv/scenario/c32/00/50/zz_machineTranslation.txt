「私はコレを頼んでみます」=“I'm going to ask for this.”
「む、ソレもいいなぁ。でもこっちも捨てがたいし……」=“Mm, that's nice too. Mm, that's nice, but I don't like this one either. ......”
「小皿を頼んで分けましょうか？　それとも、あーーーん、しましょうか？」=“Do you want me to ask for a small plate to share?　Or do you want me to ooh and aah?”
「……後者をお願いします」=“...... the latter, please.”
