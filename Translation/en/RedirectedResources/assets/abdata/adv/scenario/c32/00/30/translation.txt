「灯台は、静かに歴史を見守っている感じがして好きですね」=“Lighthouses are really nice, aren't they? They look like they're just quietly standing there, watching over history. I really like them.”
「歴史を見守ってる……面白い例えだね」=“Watching over history, huh... what an interesting metaphor.”
「灯台があるところに歴史あり、と私は思っています」=“Where there is a lighthouse, there is history, or atleast I feel that way.”
「なるほどね、確かに感慨深い建造物だからなぁ」=“I see, it is a pretty emotionally moving structure, isn't it?”
「この灯台は、どれだけの時を見守り続けているのでしょうね」=“I wonder since how long ago this lighthouse has been watching over us all?”
