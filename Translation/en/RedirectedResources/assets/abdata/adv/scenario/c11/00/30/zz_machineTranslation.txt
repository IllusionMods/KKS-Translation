「他じゃ見かけない名物がいっぱいあるね」=“There's a lot of specialties here you won't find anywhere else.”
「そうねぇ、じっくり見てるとそれだけで時間が過ぎちゃいそう」=“I'm sure you'll be able to find something that you like.”
「今日のところは、ざっと眺めるだけにしようか。なにも買わないのに長時間いたらお店にも迷惑だし」=“I'll just have a quick look around for today. I don't want to spend too much time here without buying anything.”
「あら、あそこにあるのは何かしら？　あ、向こうのも気になるわ～」=“Oh, what's that over there?　Oh, I'm curious about that one too.”
「って、思いっきり釣られてる！」=“It's not my imagination.”
