「ねえ、卓球しない？」=“Hey, do you want to play ping-pong?”
「ふふ、いいわよ～。やってみましょ♪」=“I'll try it. Let's do it.”
「ふぅ～……楽しかった」=“Hmm. ...... was fun.”
「盛り上がったわね～。もう１ゲームする？」=“That was a lot of fun. Shall we play one more game?”
「いや、いいよ。でも……卓球苦手なの？　あんまりラリー続かなかったけど」=“No, it's fine. But ...... are you not good at table tennis?　I couldn't keep up with the rallies.”
「そうね……苦手というより、あんまり経験がなかったの」=“It's not that I don't like ...... them, it's just that I haven't had much experience with them.”
「そうだったんだ……無理やり付き合わせちゃったかな？」=“That's right. ...... Did I force you to go along with me?”
「そんなことないわ。点数が入った時のあなたの喜びっぷりが可愛くて……つい見惚れちゃった」=“No, it's not. You were so happy when you got the score, it was ...... so cute, I couldn't help but notice.”
「そ、そう……？　そんなに？」=“Yeah. ......?　Really?”
「ええ♪　小さく飛び跳ねながらニコニコ笑顔を見せて……ふふ、もう一度見たくなってきちゃったわ」=“Yes, she said, jumping up and down and smiling, I'd like to see it again.”
「……あはは、なんだか恥ずかしくなってきちゃったよ」=“...... Haha, I'm starting to feel embarrassed.”
「もう、そんなこと言わないで？　ほら、もう１ゲームしましょ♪」=“Oh, my God, don't say that.　Come on, let's play one more game.”
「よ、よーし、負けないぞ……っ」=“All right, all right. I'm not going to lose. ......”
（いや、負けてないんだけどね……）=(No, I'm not losing. ......)
