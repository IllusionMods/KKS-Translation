「お、あそこにいる生き物はなんだろう……」=“Oh, what's that creature over there? ......”
「あら？　なにか珍しいものを見つけたの？」=“Oh?　Did you find something unusual?”
「うん、あそこにとまってる鳥……くちばしも身体も全体的に赤いやつ」=“Yeah, there's a bird over there ...... with a red beak and all over its body.”
「うーん…………ああ、あの子ね！　たしかに見たことない鳥さんかも」=“Hmmm. ............ Oh, that's the girl!　That's a bird I've never seen before.”
「ふふっ、あなたはよく観察してるのね。私は全然気づかなかったのにすごいわ♪」=“Hmmm, you're observing well. I didn't notice it at all, but it's amazing.”
