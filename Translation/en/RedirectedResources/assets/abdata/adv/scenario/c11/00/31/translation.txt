「綺麗な場所ね～。観光スポットとして人気があるのも分かるわ」=“What a pretty place. I can certainly see why it's so popular as a tourism spot.”
「そうだね。こうやって景色を眺めるだけでも気持ちがいいや」=“Yeah. Just looking at the scenery like this feels good on its own.”
「カップルで肩を並べて見たら、もっと素敵でしょうね」=“I imagine it'd look even more lovely, looking at this as a couple.”
「う、うん……」=“Y-Yeah...”
（他意はないんだろうけど……カップルって言われると意識しちゃうな）=(I'm sure she doesn't mean anything by it... but man if that doesn't make me conscious of it.)
