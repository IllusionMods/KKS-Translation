「ここの料理って、よく豚肉が使われてるよね」=“Pork is used in many dishes here, isn't it?”
「豚さんは鳴き声以外すべて食べるって言葉があるらしいわ。それぐらい馴染み深い食材みたい」=“There's a saying that pigs eat everything but their squeal. That's how familiar they are.”
「中には血を使ったお料理もあるんですって」=“I hear some of the dishes are made with blood.”
「ええっ！？　ほ、本当に鳴き声以外食べてるんだ……さすがに、血は遠慮しておきたいけど……」=“What?　I'm really eating, except for the squealing. ...... As expected, I'd rather refrain from blood. ......”
