「はぁ……このアーサー汁、なんだかほっとする味だなぁ」=“Haah... this clear broth has this really relaxing taste, you know~”
「海藻たっぷりで美味しそうね～。私も一口……」=“They really loaded it up with seaweed, didn't they~? Let me try some too...”

「あなたと結婚したら、私もそんなお料理が出来る様に頑張るわね」=“When we get married, I'll do my best to make my cooking taste like this too, okay?”
