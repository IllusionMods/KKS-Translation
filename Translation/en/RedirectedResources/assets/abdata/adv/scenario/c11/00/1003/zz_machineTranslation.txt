「ねえ、お土産を探してみようよ」=“Hey, let's look for some souvenirs.”
「それ、シーサーのキーホルダーだね」=“That's a shisa key chain.”
「そうなのよ。ほら、見て……可愛いと思わない？　うふふ」=“Oh, yeah. Look at ....... Isn't it cute?　Mmm-hmm.”
「うん、そうだね。でもさぁ……シーサーっ魔除けなんでしょう？　可愛くていいのかなぁ」=“Yes, you're right. But you know, ...... shisa is a charm against evil, right?　Isn't it cute and good?”
「ふふ、いいのよ。だって、これは魔除けなんかじゃなく、キーホルダーなんだもの」=“It's okay. It's not an amulet, it's a key chain.”
「怖かったら、きっと一つも売れないわ。これぐらい可愛いのがちょうどいいと思わない？」=“If it was scary, it wouldn't sell a single copy. Don't you think something as cute as this is just right?”
「まあ、たしかに……魔除け級に怖いキーホルダーなんて、下げて歩きたくないよね……」=“Well, I certainly don't want to walk around with a ...... scary key ring that's supposed to ward off evil. ......”
「あ……見てみて。これ、手作りなのね。ほら、どのシーサーも微妙に顔が違ってる」=“Oh ......, look at this. Look at this. It's handmade. See, each shisa has a slightly different face.”
「あ、ほんとだ。どの子が一番かな」=“Oh, really. Let's see which girl is the best.”
「ふふ、今手にしているこの子が一番ね……ほら、お目々が可愛い♪」=“Hmm, this one in my hands is the best. ...... Look how pretty her eyes are.”
「キミは今日からウチの子よ……よろしくね、シーちゃん♪」=“You're my baby now. ...... Nice to meet you, Shi.”
「シーサーのシーちゃんかぁ……ちょっと安易じゃない？　名付け方……」=“Shisa's Shi-chan. ...... Isn't that a bit easy?　How to name it: ......”
「いいのよ。呼びやすいのが一番なんだもの。ほら、この子も喜んでるわ……ね～、シーちゃん♪　ふふ、いい子ねー……」=“It's okay. The best thing is to be easy to call. Look, she's happy to see you. ...... Hey, Cee-Cee. ...... She's a good girl.”
（お母さんの顔になってる……）=(You've got your mother's face on. ......)
