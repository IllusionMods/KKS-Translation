「ここの料理って、よく豚肉が使われてるよね」=“A lot of dishes here use pork, don't they?”
「豚さんは鳴き声以外すべて食べるって言葉があるらしいわ。それぐらい馴染み深い食材みたい」=“They do say you can eat every part of the pig, except their whines. I imagine that's just how well they know it as an ingredient.”
「中には血を使ったお料理もあるんですって」=“Apparently there's some dishes that even use the blood.”
「ええっ！？　ほ、本当に鳴き声以外食べてるんだ……さすがに、血は遠慮しておきたいけど……」=“Eeh--!? Y-You really can eat every part except their whines, huh... I'd really rather not eat blood myself though...”
