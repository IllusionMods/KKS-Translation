「すごいねー、どこまでもずーっと水槽だよ」=“Amazing, isn't it? It's water tanks as far as the eye can see.”
「……魚より水槽が気になるの？」=“...That's what interests you, more than the fish?”
「ごめん、今のは言い方が変だったね」=“Sorry, I said something weird, didn't I?”
「ううん、謝らないで。私の方が意地悪だったかも……」=“No, don't apologize. I think I was being a bit mean...”
「……よそよそしいかな？」=“...Am I being too distant?”
「かもね。せっかくのデートなのに、お互いぺこぺこしてるのはおかしいかも」=“Well, there's certainly distance between us. It's pretty weird too, we're on a date and everything but we keep saying sorry to one another.”
「デート……」=“A date...”
「そっか……言われてみたら、よくありそうなデートだね」=“I see... now that you say it, it's a pretty standard date, isn't it?”
「そうそう。ドラマとか漫画とかで、普通に出てきそうなベタな水族館デート」=“Exactly. A corny aquarium date, straight out TV or manga.”
「……どうせなら、とことんベタにやってみる？　……女の子は、どうするのがベタなのかな……」=“...Since we're doing this anyway, wanna make it as corny as we can? ...What do I, do as a girl...”
「それはもちろん、お魚さん可愛いー♪　きゃー、アナゴさんだよー、みたいな」=“That's of course, "The fishes are so cute~♪", "Kyaah~", "Look, it's an eel~", and all.”
「それは……無理」=“I... can't.”
（撤回が早い……）=(Gave up so easily...)
「……あっさり諦めちゃう私は……可愛い女の子ではないのかも」=“...The way I give up so easily... might not be very cute of me.”
「そう？　そうやって照れてる[H名]はすごく可愛いよ」=“You think so? To me, you look adorable blushing like that, [H名].”
「もう……調子いいんだから」=“Jeez... you really love saying that stuff, don't you?”
