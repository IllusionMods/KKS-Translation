「潮風が気持ちいいね。ちょっと歩いていこうか」=“The sea breeze feels really nice, doesn't it? How about we go for a walk?”
「…………………………」=“...”
「何かいた？　珍しい鳥とか」=“You see something? A rare bird or something else maybe.”
「へ？　あ……ぼーっとしてるように見えた……？」=“Heh? Ah... did I look like I was spacing out...?”
「ただ……波の音を聞いてたの。それだけ」=“I was just... listening to the sound of the waves. That's all.”
「あ、そうだったんだ」=“Ah, I see.”
「ごめん、邪魔しちゃった？」=“Sorry, did I interrupt you?”
「ううん……気にしないで。滅多にない機会だから、聞いてただけ」=“Nuh-uh... don't mind me. I just don't heat that sound much, that's all it was.”
「海とかあんまり来ないんだっけ？」=“You don't go out to see all that much often?”
「……私がサーフィンとか、するように見える？」=“...Do I look like the sort, to surf, to you?”
「身体を動かすのは嫌いじゃなさそうだけど」=“I mean, to me you don't look like you hate moving your body, if nothing else.”
「好き嫌いと得意は別の話。それに……」=“Me liking it or hating it, and actually being any good at it, are different things. Not to mention...”
「ここに来て少しは慣れたけど、肌が出るような格好とか、ちょっと抵抗もあったから……」=“I'm a bit more used to it now ever since we came here but, I've always been a bit hesistant about wearing clothes that show too much skin, too...”
「肌がって、水着とか？」=“Like swimsuits or whatever?”
「……他にない」=“...There's only swimsuits, dummy.”
「……へー」=“...Hoh.”
「……何がへーなの？　私が恥ずかしがるのが、おかしい……？」=“...What's that "hoh" for? Is it weird, for me to feel shy...?”
「おかしくはないけど、[H名]はクールなイメージがあったから」=“It's not weird but, you've always had this "cool and aloof" image in my head, you know?”
「……何も感じてないわけじゃないから。今もちゃんと……ドキドキしてる」=“...It's not like I don't feel anything. Even now... my heart's pounding a bit.”
「え？　えっと、そ、そう……なんだ」=“Eh? Erhm, I-I... see.”
「なんで赤くなるの……？」=“Why're you blushing...?”
「不意を突かれたからに決まってるでしょ！　ヤバい、俺まで顔が熱くなってきた」=“Of course I'm blushing, you hit me with that out of nowhere! Damn, now it's even getting hot.”
「フフ……変なの。潮風に冷ましてもらったら？」=“Fufuh... you're weird. Why not cool down in the breeze a bit?”
「……だね、もうちょっと歩こうか」=“...Good idea, let's walk a bit more.”
