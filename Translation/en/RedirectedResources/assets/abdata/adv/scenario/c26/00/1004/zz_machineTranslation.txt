「あ、そうだったんだ」=“Oh, yeah.”
「ごめん、邪魔しちゃった？」=“I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?”
「ううん……気にしないで。滅多にない機会だから、聞いてただけ」=“No ......, don't worry about it. I'm just asking because it's a rare opportunity.”
「海とかあんまり来ないんだっけ？」=“You don't come to the beach much, do you?”
「……私がサーフィンとか、するように見える？」=“...... Do I look like I surf or something?”
