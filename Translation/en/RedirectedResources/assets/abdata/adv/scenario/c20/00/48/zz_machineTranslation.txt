「見慣れない料理ばかりだけど、どれも美味しいね」=“It's all very strange, but it's all very good.”
「はい……きっと、どれも全部ここの郷土料理なんでしょうね」=“Yes ......, I'm sure they're all local dishes here.”
「滅多に食べられないんだから、たくさん食べておかないと勿体ないよ」=“You don't get to eat them very often, so you'd better eat a lot.”
「そうですね……私も、もっと食べますから」=“That's right. ...... I'll eat more.”
