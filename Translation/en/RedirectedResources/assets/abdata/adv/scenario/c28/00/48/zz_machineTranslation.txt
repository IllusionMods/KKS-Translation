「ふぅ……どんな旅先でも、こういったホテルでの食事は安心できるのが良いの」=“Whenever I travel, it's always good to be able to eat in a hotel like this.”
「だね。実際、食べ物っでのチャレンジは勇気がいるからなぁ……」=“Right. Actually, it takes courage to challenge yourself with food. ......”
「まぁそういったものを求めるなら地元らしい店に行けばよいだけだからの。機会があれば今度行ってみるかの？」=“Well, if you're looking for something like that, just go to a local store. If you have a chance, why don't you go there sometime?”
「そうだね。まあそれはまたの機会にだ」=“That's right. Well, we'll talk about it another time.”
「んむ、今は目の前の食事をありがたく頂くのじゃ」=“Mmm, for now, just enjoy the meal in front of you.”
