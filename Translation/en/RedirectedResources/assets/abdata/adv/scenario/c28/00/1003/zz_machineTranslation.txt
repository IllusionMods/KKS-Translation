「お土産を探してみようよ」=“Let's go look for some souvenirs.”
「へぇ、夏らしいの見つけたねー」=“Wow, what a summery find.”
「む？　うむ、夏らしいといえばそうかもしれないのじゃ」=“Hmm?　Well, it's summery, I suppose.”
「それ気に入ったんじゃないの？」=“Don't you like it?”
「気に入ったというか……まぁ、目についたと言えなくもないのじゃ」=“It's not that I liked it, it's just ...... that it caught my eye.”
「なら、買っちゃえば？　思い出にもなるだろうし」=“Why don't you just buy one?　It's a good memory.”
「お主のようにそうパッパッと判断できればよいのかもしれぬが……」=“I wish I could be as quick to judge as you are. ......”
「何か引っかかるの？　めっちゃ高額とか」=“What's the catch?　Like, really expensive?”
「そういわけでなくてな……その、なんじゃ……」=“That's not what I meant. ...... What's ...... that?”
「……わしにこういうハイカラなものは似合わないかもしれぬ、と思っての」=“...... I'm not sure I'm cut out for this kind of high-fashion stuff.”
「なんだ、そんなこと？　[H名]は可愛いから何を着たって似合うよ」=“What, you mean like that?　[H名] is pretty and looks good in whatever she wears.”
「かわっ、お、お主……！」=“Oh, my God, you're ......!”
「そう思ってなかったらお付き合いしてないから」=“If I didn't think so, I wouldn't be in a relationship with you.”
「そうかもしれぬが……」=“Maybe so, but ......”
「あはは。それで、どうするのそれ？　なんなら俺がプレゼントしようか」=“Haha. So, what are you going to do with it?　I'll give it to you.”
「よ、よい！　自分で買うのじゃ」=“Good, good!　You'll have to buy it yourself.”
