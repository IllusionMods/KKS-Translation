「お主とはなかなか話が合うのう。わしとこうまで語れる者がおるとは」=“It is not a bad thing for me to talk with you. I never thought I'd find anyone who could talk to me like this.”
「俺もそう思うよ。話しても話し足りないくらいだね」=“I think so too. I can't talk about it enough.”
「また時間があったらこれからもわしのところへ来るがよい」=“Come back to me when you have time.”
「お主との談笑も悪くない。わしがそう言っているのだから来るのじゃぞ」=“My heart is very full just being here with you. It's not a bad idea to have a chat with you, that's why you're here.”
「俺も、[H姓]さんと話すのは楽しいし、喜んで来させてもらうよ」=“I, too, enjoy talking to you, [H姓], and would be happy to come over.”
「うむ、待っておるぞ」=“Yes, I'll be waiting.”
「……おぉ、もうこんな時間か。それではさらばじゃ」=“...... Oh, it's getting late. Goodbye, then.”
