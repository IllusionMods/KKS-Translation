「バナナボートの方が良かったんじゃない？」=“Maybe banana boats would have been better.”
「いいのよ、シュノーケリングの方が楽しいもの」=“It's okay, snorkeling is more fun.”
「もしかして、苦手だった？」=“Maybe you're not good at it?”

「俺は思いっきりしがみ付いて欲しいけどなぁ」=“I want you to cling to me with all your might.”
「はぁ……そう言うと思った。ほら、いつまでもバナナボートを見てないで潜りましょ」=“I knew you'd say that, ....... Don't keep looking at the banana boat, let's dive.”
