「すごく綺麗な眺めね。まるで海面に星空を書き写したみたい……」=“Such a beautiful view. It's like the ocean surface is mirroring the starry sky...”
「夜になるとこの浜に海ほたるが現れることがあるんだって」=“It's said that sea firefiles may sometimes appear on this beach.”
「そうなの。訪れたタイミングがよかったのね」=“Is that so? Then we timed our visit here well.”
「こんな素敵な場所で、あなたと二人きりでいられるなんて……なんだか夢のよう」=“I never thought I'd be alone with you in such a wonderful place... it's like a dream, somehow.”
「この星空のような海で泳いだら、銀河の果てまで行けるのかしら？」=“If we were to swim in this starry sea, I wonder if we could go all the way to the edge of the galaxy?”
「星空を自由に泳げるならどこに行きたい？」=“If you could swim across the stars, where would you go?”
「うーん、そうね……やっぱり月かしら」=“Hmm, let me see... the moon, I guess.”
「あまり遠く離れたら、地球で待つあなたに逢いに行けなくなるもの」=“If I went too far, I wouldn't be able to go meet you waiting for me on Earth.”
「一緒に連れていってはくれないの？」=“You wouldn't take me with you?”
「残念。宇宙船私号は一人乗りなの」=“Unfortunately, the "Starship Me" is a one-man craft.”
「けれど……ふふっ、そうね。席を詰めれば、もう一人くらいは乗れるかしら？」=But... fufu, let me see. If we cram the seat, we could probably get one more person on board”
「ほら、もっと近くに寄って。乗り遅れたら本当に置いていっちゃうわよ？」=“Come on, get closer. You'd really be left behind if you don't get on your seat fast .”
「おっとそいつは大変だ。これからもずっと[H名]のそばにいたいからね」=“Oooh dang, I better hurry up and get on board then. Wouldn't want to leave you forever alone in space, now would I?”
「歯の浮くような台詞ね。でも、今だけは許してあげる」=“That's one cheesy line you got there. But, I'll let it slide this one time.”
「私も同じ気持ちだもの。これからもずっと、あなたのそばにいたい」=“Because I feel the same way too. I want to be with you, from now till forever.”
「静かな夜ね。波の音しか聞こえないわ。まるで世界が止まったかのよう……」=“Quiet night, don't you think? Only the sound of the waves. It's as if the world had stopped...”
「たとえ世界が今日終わっても、最後まで[H名]のそばにいるよ」=“Even if the world were to end today, I'd be by your side until the end, [H名].”
「くすっ。ありがと」=*Chuckles* “Thank you.”
「けれど、あまり無理しなくていいわよ？　顔が真っ赤じゃない」=“But, you don't have to try that hard, you know? Your face's bright red.”
「あはは……背伸びしすぎたかな。上手く口が回らないや」=“Ahaha... maybe I was a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm starting to lose my own words.”
「ふふっ。あなたの気持ちはよく伝わったわ」=“Fufu. You've communicated your feelings well enough.”
「これ以上、言葉はいらないわわね。今はただ静かに、波の音に耳を傾けましょう……」=“Words are no longer needed from here. Now, let us quietly take in the sounds of the waves this evening...”
