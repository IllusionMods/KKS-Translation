「卓球台があるし、勝負しようよ」=“We've got a ping pong table here, so let's have a little match.”
「はぁはぁ……ま、負けたわ……」=“Haahaah... I-I lost...”
「やった、勝ったーーー！」=“I did it, I won~!”
「女の子相手に本気を出すなんて。紳士にあるまじき行いね」=“I can't believe you went all out. So ungentlemanly.”
「でも、手を抜いたら怒るでしょ？」=“But, if I didn't, you'd have gotten mad, no?”
「それはもちろん。今のはただの八つ当たり」=“Of course. That was just me venting my frustration.”
「卓球って思っていたより難しいわね。あなどっていたわ……」=“Ping pong's much harder than it looks, huh? I took it too lightly...”
「コツを教えようか？」=“Want me to teach you?”
「お願いしようかしら。負けたままでは悔しいもの」=“I might just take you up on that. Losing like that was really frustrating.”
「私を本気にさせた責任、取ってもらうから。ふふふふふ……」=“I'm gonna have you take full responsibility, for making me get serious about this. Fufufufufuh...”
（うわ……、目が本気だ。[H名]が勝つまで許してくれなさそうだなぁ……）=(Uwah... her eyes are really serious. Doesn't seem like she's gonna let me go until she wins...)
