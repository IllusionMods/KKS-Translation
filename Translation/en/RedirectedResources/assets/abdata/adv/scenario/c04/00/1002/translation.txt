「卓球台があるし、勝負しようよ」=“Hey, there's a ping-pong table here. Let's play.”
「はぁはぁ……ま、負けたわ……」=“Ahaa ahaa... well, I lost...”
「やった、勝ったーーー！」=“I did it, I won---!”
「女の子相手に本気を出すなんて。紳士にあるまじき行いね」=“I can't believe you'd go so hard against a girl. That's unbecoming of a gentleman.”
「でも、手を抜いたら怒るでしょ？」=“But you'd be upset if I held back, wouldn't you?”
「それはもちろん。今のはただの八つ当たり」=“Of course I would. That was just a little outburst.”
「卓球って思っていたより難しいわね。あなどっていたわ……」=“Table tennis is harder than I thought. I underestimated you...”
「コツを教えようか？」=“Want me to give you some tips?”
「お願いしようかしら。負けたままでは悔しいもの」=“Maybe I should ask. It's no fun losing.”
「私を本気にさせた責任、取ってもらうから。ふふふふふ……」=“You'll have to deal with consequences of taking me seriously. Fufufufufu...”
（うわ……、目が本気だ。[H名]が勝つまで許してくれなさそうだなぁ……）=(Fuwa... such a serious stare. I don't think you're gonna let me off the hook until you win, [H名]...)
