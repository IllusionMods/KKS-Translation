「すごく綺麗な眺めね。まるで海面に星空を書き写したみたい……」=“What a beautiful view. It almost looks like the stars have been traced onto the sea...”
「夜になるとこの浜に海ほたるが現れることがあるんだって」=“Apparently, it's pretty common for sea fireflies to show up at night around here.”
「そうなの。訪れたタイミングがよかったのね」=“I see. We came at a good time then.”
「こんな素敵な場所で、あなたと二人きりでいられるなんて……なんだか夢のよう」=“I can't believe we get to be alone here together, in such a wonderful place... it's feels like a dream.”
「この星空のような海で泳いだら、銀河の果てまで行けるのかしら？」=“I wonder, would you eventually reach the milky way, if you took off swimming in a starry sea like this?”
「星空を自由に泳げるならどこに行きたい？」=“If you could swim freely in the sky, where would you want to go?”
「うーん、そうね……やっぱり月かしら」=“Nnn, that's a good question... it'd have to be the moon.”
「あまり遠く離れたら、地球で待つあなたに逢いに行けなくなるもの」=“If I go too far, I wouldn't be able to come back and see you back here on Earth anytime.”
「一緒に連れていってはくれないの？」=“What, you won't take me with you?”
「残念。宇宙船私号は一人乗りなの」=“Sadly, no. The spaceship [H] is a single seater only.”
「けれど……ふふっ、そうね。席を詰めれば、もう一人くらいは乗れるかしら？」=“But... fufuh--, let's see. We could probably get away with stuffing in one more seat.”
「ほら、もっと近くに寄って。乗り遅れたら本当に置いていっちゃうわよ？」=“C'mon, come closer. If you don't get on, I really will leave you behind, you know?”
「おっとそいつは大変だ。これからもずっと[H名]のそばにいたいからね」=“Woah, we can't have that. I don't want to let you go just yet afterall, my dear [H名].”
「歯の浮くような台詞ね。でも、今だけは許してあげる」=“What a cliche line. But, I'll let it go just this once.”
「私も同じ気持ちだもの。これからもずっと、あなたのそばにいたい」=“I feel the same way, afterall. I don't want to let you go either, I want to be with you forever.”
「[H名]……」=“[H名]...”
「静かな夜ね。波の音しか聞こえないわ。まるで世界が止まったかのよう……」=“What a quiet night. I can't hear a thing except for the waves. It almost feels like the world's come to a standstill...”
「たとえ世界が今日終わっても、最後まで[H名]のそばにいるよ」=“Even if the world ends today, I'll still be right here with you till the end, [H名].”
「くすっ。ありがと」=“*Giggle*. Thanks.”
「けれど、あまり無理しなくていいわよ？　顔が真っ赤じゃない」=“But, you don't need to overdo it, okay? Your face is going tomato red.”
「あはは……背伸びしすぎたかな。上手く口が回らないや」=“Ahahah... yeah, maybe I overdid it a bit. It's hard to find the right words.”
「ふふっ。あなたの気持ちはよく伝わったわ」=“Fufuh--. Don't worry, your feelings got to me just fine.”
「これ以上、言葉はいらないわわね。今はただ静かに、波の音に耳を傾けましょう……」=“We don't really need any more words between us, do we? Let's just lend our ears to the waves for now...”
