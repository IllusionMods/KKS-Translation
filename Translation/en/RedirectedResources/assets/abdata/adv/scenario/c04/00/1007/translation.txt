「さすがは南の島だね。カラフルな魚ばかりだ」=“I guess that's a southern island for you, there's not one fish that's not colorful.”
「とても素敵なアクアリウムね。けれど、ここで暮らす魚達は幸せなのかしら？」=“What a lovely aquarium, really. But, do you think the fishes living here are happy?”
「どういう意味？」=“What do you mean?”
「すぐそばに綺麗な海が広がっているのに、こんな狭い水槽に閉じ込められて……なんだか可哀想」=“Even though there's such a beautiful sea right close by, they're locked up in such a tiny tank... I feel bad, honestly.”
「難しい質問だね。餌の心配をしなくていいから、魚達は安心して暮らしているんじゃないかな」=“That's a pretty tough question. They don't have to worry about food while they're in here so, they're probably living in relative ease, no?”
「だけどそれは管理された幸せよね。危険がない代わりに、見世物にされて……」=“But that's almost fake happiness, isn't it? In return for a safe life, they have to make a spectacle out of themselves...”
「もしも私が人魚として水族館で見世物にされていたら、あなたはどうする？」=“If I got locked up in a fishtank as a mermaid, what would you do?”
「今すぐ助けに行くよ」=“I'd come save you right away, of course.”
「ふふっ。即答なのね」=“Fufuh--. Didn't take you even a single beat, huh?”
「私も同じ気持ちよ。もしもあなたが王子様だったら、この場で愛を歌うわ」=“I feel the same way. If you were my prince charming, I'd croon out my love for you from right here.”
「さっきの質問の答えだけれど、暮らす場所は問題ではなくて、誰がそばにいるのかが大事なのかも」=“As an answer to that question, I think rather than the place, who's by your side would be more important.”
「私が魚であなたが飼育員。あなたにだったら飼われてもいいかも……なんてね。ふふっ」=“Me, as a fish, and you, as my keeper. I don't think I'd mind that arrangement so much... just an idle thought. Fufuh--”
