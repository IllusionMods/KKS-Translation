「さてと、せっかく海に来たんだし一緒に泳いじゃう？」=Well, since we're at the beach, why don't we go for a swim?
「えっと……今日はのんびりと歩くぐらいがいいかな」=Well, ...... I think I'll just take a leisurely walk today.
「そうなの？　ふふ、意外と奥手なのね」=Really?　You're a little more reserved than I thought.
「だって、いきなりそんな距離感で来られたら困るでしょ？」=I mean, you don't want to come at me from a distance like that, do you?
「君が本当にその気なら、私は別にいいけど？」=If you really want to, I don't mind, okay?
（うっ……勇気を出せばよかった）=(Ugh ......, I should have been brave.)
