「思えば、灯台を近くで見る機会はこれまでなかったな」=“Come to think of it, I've never had the chance to look at a lighthouse up close before.”
「言われてみれば確かに。遠目に見たことは何度かあったけど、近くに来たことはなかった気がするよ」=“That's true. I've seen it from a distance a few times, but I don't think I've ever been up close.”
「まぁ、近くで見たところで何だと言う話にはなるが」=“Well, what's the point of looking so closely?”
「ははは……灯台自体はそうかもしれないけど、ここは良い場所じゃない？　風が気持ちいいしね」=“Hahaha ...... The lighthouse itself may be, but isn't this a nice place?　The breeze feels good.”
「そうだな。しばらくここで涼むとするか」=“I'm sure it will. I think I'll stay here and cool off for a while.”
