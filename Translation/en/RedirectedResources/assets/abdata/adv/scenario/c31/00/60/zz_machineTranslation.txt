「……直球に言うと、急におまえの温もりがほしくなったんだ」=“...... To put it bluntly, I suddenly wanted your warmth.”
「だから……何も言わず私のことを抱きしめてくれっ」=“So ...... don't say anything and just hug me.”
「……留守か、もう寝たか……待っててもしょうがないし、私も今日は休むとしよう」=“...... He's not home, or he's already gone to bed. ...... There's no point in waiting, I'm going to take the day off.”
