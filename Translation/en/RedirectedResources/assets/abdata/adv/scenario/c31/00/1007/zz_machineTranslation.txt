「むむむむ……」=“Mmmm......”
「ねぇ、[H名]。水槽と睨めっこしてどうしたの？」=“Hey, [H名], he said. What's wrong with you staring at the fish tank?”
「……魚は、どうしてこんなに無表情な顔をしているんだろうな？」=“Why do ...... fish have such expressionless faces?”
「さっきからこっちを睨んでいるような気がして、負けじと睨み返しているところだ」=“I've been feeling like you've been staring at me for a while now, so I'm staring back.”
「なにも魚に対して負けん気を発揮しなくてもいいと思うんだけど……」=“I don't think you have to be so competitive with the fish. ......”
「でも、気持ちはわかるよ。魚の瞳って少し不気味なところがあるよね」=“I know what you mean, though. Fish eyes can be a little creepy, can't they?”
「だろ？　だから今は邪魔するな。まだ勝負はついていないんだからな」=“Right?　So don't interrupt me now. The game's not over yet.”
「むむむむむ……」=“Mmmmmmm ......”
「あっ、魚があっちにいっちゃった……」=“Oh, the fish went that way. ......”
「よし、私の勝ちだ」=“Okay, I win.”
「どうだ、見ただろ？　フフッ、魚なんて物の数じゃないな」=“Did you see that?　Huh, fish don't count.”
「ははっ。そうやってはしゃぐ[H名]は可愛いね」=“Haha. [H名] is so cute when she talks like that.”
「か、かわいいだと……？」=“You think I'm cute. ......?”
「うん。どれだけ見てても飽きない気がするよ」=“Yeah. I don't think I'll ever get tired of looking at it.”
「っ……こっちを見るな」=“...... Don't look at me.”
「何だったら、俺と睨めっこしてみる？」=“Why don't you just stare at me?”
「だから、こっちを見るなと言ってるだろっ。あーもう、ほら、次の水槽を見に行くぞ」=“I'm telling you, don't look at me. I'm telling you, don't look at me. - Oh, come on, let's go see the next tank.”
