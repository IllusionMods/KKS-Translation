「こういう所で出る食事って、旅先ではちょっと安心するわよね」=“The food served at these places is a little comforting when you're traveling.”
「なんかわかるかも、見たことがある・知ってる料理があるからかな？」=“I think I know what it is. Maybe it's because I've seen it before. Maybe it's because I know the food.”
「そこから味がある程度想像つくから、というのもあるわね」=“That's partly because you can get a certain idea of what it tastes like.”
「新しいモノにチャレンジもいいけど、そういった安心して食べられるってのも大事だよね」=“It's good to try new things, but it's also important to be able to eat without worry.”
「えぇ。っと、冷めないうちに頂きましょ？」=“Yes. Well, let's eat before it gets cold, shall we?”
