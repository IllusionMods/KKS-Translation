「ちょっとお店を見てみようよ」=“Let's take a look around the stores.”
「なぁ……これ、似合うと思う？」=“Hey ......, do you think this looks good on me?”
「うーん、ちょっと派手かな？　でもこの地域にピッタリって感じだね」=“Hmm, a little flamboyant, I guess.　But it's perfect for the area.”
「そうそう、ピッタリだよな。いかにも暑い国のデザインって感じでさ」=“Yes, it's perfect, isn't it? It's like a hot country design.”
「それ、買うの？」=“Are you buying that?”
「ああ、もちろん。んーっと、サイズはこれで合うかな？」=“Yeah, of course. Um, do you think this will fit?”
「サイズ？　ほら、ここに書いてあるよ」=“What size?　It's written right here.”
「じゃなくって、おまえのサイズだよ。これおまえにピッタリか？」=“It's not about the size, it's about your size. Is this the right size for you?”
「えっ？　俺に似合うかどうかの話だったの？」=“What?　Were you talking about whether or not I look good in it?”
「そういうこと。まあ、別にすぐ着なくていいよ。旅の思い出として、持ち帰ってくれればそれでオッケーだ」=“That's it. Well, you don't have to wear it right away. Just take it home with you as a memory of your trip. That's all right.”
「ふ～ん……じゃ、俺も[H名]の分を買うよ。これでペアルックだね」=“I'll buy one for [H名], too. Now we look like a pair.”
「ぺ、ペアルック！？　そういうのナシだ、やっぱ買うの止めよう」=“Pairing off?　I don't do that kind of thing. I'm not buying that.”
「それは残念」=“That's too bad.”
