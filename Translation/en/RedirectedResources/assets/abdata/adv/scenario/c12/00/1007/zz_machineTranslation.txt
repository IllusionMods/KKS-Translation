「はぁぁ……綺麗だな。見てるだけで、いい気分になれそうだ」=Haha ...... You're beautiful. Just looking at it makes me feel good.
「うん、綺麗だね。あ、この水槽はこの辺りの近海を再現してるんだって」=Yes, it's beautiful. I heard that this tank is a replica of the sea around here.
「え？　じゃあ、わざわざ水槽に入れなくてもいいんじゃないか？」=What?　Then you don't have to put it in a tank, do you?
「だよね、そこらの海で泳げばいいんだし」=Yeah, we'll just swim in the ocean there.
「でもまぁ、泳ぐのが好きじゃなくて、魚を見るのが好きって人もいるだろうしな」=But then again, some people don't like to swim, they like to look at fish.
「そうだね。そういう人がアクアリウムにお金をかけるのかも」=That's right. Maybe that's why people spend so much money on aquariums.
「あれはいいな。ただ始めるハードルが高いんだよな。お金やら部屋の大きさやら設備やら色々かかるし」=I like that one. It's just that the hurdles to getting started are high. It takes a lot of money, a lot of room, a lot of equipment.
「たしかに……凝ったやつはお金がないと厳しそうだ」=It's true that ...... elaborate things are hard to come by without money.
「まぁ、海が見たくなったら、またここに来ればいいんじゃないか？」=Well, if you want to see the ocean, why don't you just come back here?
「そうだね。それがいいよ。ここは楽しいし」=That's right. That's a good idea. It's fun here.
「……金も時間も気力もなければ、近所の水族館にいくってのもありだな」=...... If you don't have the money, time or energy, you could always go to the local aquarium.
「俺とのデートなら、それでもいいよ」=If you want to go on a date with me, that's fine.
「ああ、もちろんだ。水族館だけじゃなく、いろんなところに二人で行かないとな」=Yes, of course. We'll have to go to more places together than just the aquarium.
「うん、楽しみにしてるよ」=Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
「さあ、他の場所も見てみるとするか。深海コーナーの薄暗い感じ、あたし好きなんだよな――」=I'd like to go to , but it's so imposing, isn't it?" "Well, let's take a look at the other places. I like the dimness of the deep sea section.
