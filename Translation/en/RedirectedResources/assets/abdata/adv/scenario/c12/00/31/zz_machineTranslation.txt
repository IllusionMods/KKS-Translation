「そういえば、灯台をこんな間近で見たのって初めてかも」=“Come to think of it, this might be the first time I've seen a lighthouse this close up.”
「老朽化とか色々問題があるみたいだしね。間近で見ることが出来る場所は、少ないんじゃないかな」=“It seems to have a lot of problems with aging. There are only a few places where you can see it up close.”
「なーるほどねぇ。じゃあ、この光景を目に焼き付けときますか」=“Oh, I see. Well, I'd better capture this scene.”
「だね。素敵な景色を忘れないようにしよう」=“That's right. Let's not forget the beautiful scenery.”
