「灯台って、近くで見ると結構迫力あるよね」=“Lighthouses are pretty impressive when you see them up close, aren't they?”
「うーん、キミと登ってみたかったけど……階段を使うのはちょっと無謀かもだねー」=“Hmm, I wanted to climb with you, but using the ...... stairs might be a bit reckless.”
「それは……二人で話しながらでも流石に疲れそうかな……」=“It's ...... going to be exhausting for both of us to talk about it. ......”
「ここは風が気持ちいいしねー。無理して登らなくても、お話してるだけで十分楽しいさー」=“The breeze feels good here. You don't have to go up there. It's fun just to talk.”
「そうだね。今度来る時はお弁当でも持ってきて、二人で食べたいかも」=“That's right. Maybe next time we'll bring our lunches and eat them together.”
「それ、大賛成！　先に言ってくれたら、キミの分も自分がお弁当作るよー。楽しみにしててー」=“I'm all for it!　If you tell me first, I'll make lunch for you, too. Look forward to it.”
