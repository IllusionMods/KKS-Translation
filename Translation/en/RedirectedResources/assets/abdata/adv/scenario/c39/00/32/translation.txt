「うーん、キミと登ってみたかったけど……階段を使うのはちょっと無謀かもだねー」=“Hmm, I wanted to try climbing it with you... but taking the stairs might be a bit reckless-”
「それは……二人で話しながらでも流石に疲れそうかな……」=“That... I think we'd be too tired to talk if we ended up doing that...”
「ここは風が気持ちいいしねー。無理して登らなくても、お話してるだけで十分楽しいさー」=“The breeze feels good here- We don't have to force ourselves to climb it. Just talking is fun enough-”
「そうだね。今度来る時はお弁当でも持ってきて、二人で食べたいかも」=“That's right. Maybe, the next time we come here, we might want to bring lunches and eat them together.”
「それ、大賛成！　先に言ってくれたら、キミの分も自分がお弁当作るよー。楽しみにしててー」=“I'm all for it!　If you tell me first, I'll make lunch for you, too- Look forward to it-”
