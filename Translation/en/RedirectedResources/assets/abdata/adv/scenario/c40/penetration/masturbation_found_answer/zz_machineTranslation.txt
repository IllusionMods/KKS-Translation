「……覗くだけでは満足できんか……まあ、貴殿ならばそう来るだろうと思っていたぞ」=“You can't get enough ...... peeking? ...... well, I knew you would come to that.”
「お互いにしたいことは一緒なのだ、断る理由もあるまい。むしろ、どう楽しむかの方が重要だ」=“We both want to do the same thing, so there is no reason for us to refuse each other. Instead, it's more about how we enjoy ourselves.”
