「凄いね、こんな豪華な部屋で過ごせるなんて夢みたいだ」=“It's amazing. It's like a dream come true to have such a luxurious room.”
「ああ、まるで王族にでもなったようだな」=“Yeah, it's like being royalty.”
「うんうん、ほんと何もかも大きくて豪華で王様って感じ」=“Yeah, yeah, everything's really big and gorgeous and kingly.”
「最早、部屋と呼ぶには大きすぎるな。軽く散歩でもできそうだ」=“It's too big to be called a room at this early stage," he said. It's too big to be called a room any more.”
「なら、二人で散歩する？　プールで泳ぐとかでもいいよ」=“Well, do you want to go for a walk together?　Or we could go for a swim in the pool.”
「いや、我はここでいい。豪華な部屋で過ごすより、外で控えている方が性に合っている」=“No, I'm fine here. No, I'm fine here. I'd rather stay out in the open than in a luxurious room.”
「そっか……じゃあ俺も一緒に……」=“I see. ...... then I'll go with you. ......”
「貴殿は色々見てきてもいいのだぞ。折角これだけの部屋に来たのだ、無理して我に付き合う必要は無い」=“You can go and see all kinds of things," he said. You have come to the right room, you don't have to stay here with me.”
「別に無理はしてないよ。どんな豪華な部屋より、大好きな彼女の隣にいたいってだけ」=“I'm not pushing it. I just want to be next to the girl I love more than any luxury room.”
「なっ……また貴殿はそうして我をからかって……」=“Oh, ......, you're teasing me again, .......”
「はは、でもほんとに俺が一人で行っちゃったら寂しかったでしょう？」=“Ha, but you really would have missed me if I'd gone alone, wouldn't you?”
「それは、まぁ……結局のところついていってしまっただろうな……」=“That, well, ...... would have followed me after all. ......”
「あー、いいね。俺の後ろをちょこちょこついてくる[H名]とか可愛すぎる」=“Oh, good. [H名] following behind me a little bit, too cute.”
「そ、そうか？　普段だって、貴殿の後ろをついて歩くことはあるだろう？」=“Yeah?　I'm sure I usually walk behind you, don't I?”
「いやいや、[H名]って普段は用心棒みたいに自信満々な感じでついてくるからさ……」=“No, no, no, [H名] usually follows me around like a confident bouncer...”
「寂しくなってちょこちょこついてきちゃうってのが、凄く可愛いポイントなんだよ」=“The fact that he gets lonely and follows you around is a very cute point.”
「むぅ……やはり散歩はやめよう。大きな部屋だからと歩き回るのは少々品性に欠ける……」=“I still don't want to go for a walk. It's a little undignified to walk around because it's a big room. ......”
「はは、そうだね。じゃあ乾杯して、上品な時間を楽しもうか」=“Ha, yes. Well then, let's have a toast and enjoy a classy time.”
「うむ、乾杯だ……貴殿と我の素敵な時間に……」=“Well, here's to ...... a wonderful time for you and me.”
「うん、乾杯……でも流石だね、そういう乾杯の口上とかスラっと出てきちゃうんだから」=“Yeah, it's a great toast at ......, because you can say that kind of toast without hesitation.”
「[H名]はこういう部屋似合ってると思うよ。実際、女王様みたいなところあるしね」=“I think [H名] would look good in a room like this. In fact, I think she's a bit of a queen.”
「なにっ、我が女王？　それは流石におだて過ぎだろう……」=“What, my queen?　That would be too much flattery for the quintessential ......”
「そうかな？　[H名]が女王様だったら、俺なら喜んで仕えちゃうけど」=“I don't think so.　If [H名] were a queen, I'd be happy to serve her.”
「むぅぅ……仕える、なのか？　我が女王なら、貴殿は王様……ではないのか？」=“Mmm ...... serve you, huh?　If you are my queen, aren't you the king ......?”
「えっ、それこそ俺が王様とか……調子に乗り過ぎじゃない？」=“What, that's exactly why I'm king or ...... getting too carried away?”
「はは、二人とも大分この部屋の雰囲気に当てられてしまっているな。分相応という言葉を思い出そう」=“I think both of you have been taken in by the atmosphere of this room. Let's remember the word reasonable.”
「だね……でもさ、ちょっと憧れるよね。こういう豪華な部屋で二人で暮らせたらって……」=“I know. ...... but I kind of long for it. I wish we could live together in a luxurious room like this. ......”
「まぁ、そういう夢が無いと言えば嘘になるが……我は貴殿と一緒に居られるなら、場所は何処だっていい」=“Well, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have such dreams, but ...... I don't care where I am as long as I can be with you.”
「何処にいるかより、誰といるかが重要だと。貴殿の剣となってからは、常々そう感じている」=“He said, "It's not where you are, but who you are with that matters. Since becoming your sword, I have always felt that way.”
「[H名]……ありがとう、俺は幸せ者だね」=“Thank you [H名]..., I'm a lucky man.”
「いつか……俺が頑張って本当にこういう部屋に住めるようになったらさ、その時は……」=“Someday ...... I'll work hard and really get to live in a room like this, then ......”
「ああ、できることなら我も傍に置いて欲しい……邪魔にならぬよう、部屋の隅に控えているから」=“Oh, if you can, I'd like you to have me by your side ...... so I can stay out of the way and in the corner of the room.”
「うーん。そこは隅っこじゃなくて、できれば俺の隣に居て欲しかったんだけど……」=“I'm not sure I'd like that. I wanted you there, not in the corner, preferably next to me. ......”
「う、うむ……確かに、これだけ広い部屋だと離れていては貴殿を守り切れないかもしれないからな……」=“Ummm......... indeed, because a room this large may not be able to protect you if you stay away.........”
「[H名]……今は二人きりなんだし、もう少し素直に言って欲しいな」=“[H名]... now that it's just the two of us, I wish you would be a little more honest with me.”
「うぅ……分かった。我はいつでも貴殿の傍にいたい……大好きな人と、片時も離れたくないんだ」=“Ugh. ...... got it. I want to be by your side at all times,...... and I don't want to be separated from the person I love, even for a moment.”
「うん、俺も……ちょっとこの部屋は、俺達には広すぎたかもね」=“Yeah, I ...... think this room might be a little too big for us.”
「ふふ、そうだな。たまにこうして楽しませてもらう程度が、我等には丁度いいのかもしれない」=“'Hmmm, yes, I suppose so. Perhaps it is better for us to be entertained occasionally.”
