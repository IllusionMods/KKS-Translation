「ねぇ、オイル塗ってあげようか？　背中側とか、自分じゃ塗り辛いでしょ？」=“Hey, do you want me to oil you up?　It's hard to apply it to your backside, isn't it?”
「うむ、確かに背中は自分では塗れないな……貴殿に頼むのが得策か」="Well, I certainly can't paint my back myself, so I guess it's a good idea to ask ...... you to do it for me."
「そうそう、絶対その方がいいよ。ちゃんとしっかり塗るからさ」=“Yes, yes, that's definitely the way to go. I'll make sure it's coated properly.”
「はは、そこまで気合が入っているなら間違いないか……では、よろしく頼む」=Ha, if you're that enthusiastic, I'm sure you're right. ......, so please do me a favor."
「うん、よろしく頼まれました！　後は俺に任せてよ」=Yes, he asked me to take care of him!　I'll take care of the rest."
