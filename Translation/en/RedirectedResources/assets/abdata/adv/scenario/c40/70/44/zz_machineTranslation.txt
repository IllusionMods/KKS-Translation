「もしかして結構手先器用だったりする？　[H名]のシーサー、作りが凄い細かいよね……」=“Are you by any chance quite good with your hands?　[H名]'s shisa, it's so finely made...”
「ん？　これくらい普通だと思うぞ？　確かに凝り性ではあるが……感覚的には武具の手入れと同じだな」=“Hmm?　This is about as normal as it gets, don't you think?　It's certainly elaborate, but in ...... sense it's the same as taking care of your armor.”
「なんか……完成したの並べたら出来が違い過ぎて凹みそう……」=“I feel ...... like I'm going to be depressed when I put the finished products together because they're so different. ......”
「む……なら完成したシーサーを交換するというのはどうだ？　その方が我も更に気合が入るしな」=“How about replacing the finished Shisa with a new one?　It would give me even more energy.”
「それはいいアイディアだと思うけど……本当にいいの？　俺のシーサーの出来には期待できないよ？」=“'I think that's a great idea, but ...... are you sure?　I can't expect my Ceasar to be any good, can I?”
「出来は関係ない。貴殿が作ったことが大事なのだ。だから気にせず、貴殿らしいシーサーを作ってくれ」=“It doesn't matter how well it's done. What matters is that you made it. So don't worry about it and make a shisa just like you.”
