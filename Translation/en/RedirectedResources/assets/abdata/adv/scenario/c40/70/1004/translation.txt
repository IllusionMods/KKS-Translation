「風が気持ちいいね。少し浜辺を歩いていこうよ」=“The breeze feels really nice, doesn't it? Let's go for a walk along the beach.”
「フ……まさか我が、こんなに穏やかに海を眺められる日が来るとは……」=“Fuh... to think the day would come, where I would get to simply savour a peaceful view of the sea like this...”
「海に何か嫌な思い出でもあったの？」=“Got some bad memories related to the sea or something?”
「そういうわけでは無いが、海を見ると何故かいつも不安になることが多くてな……」=“Not precisely, however, whenever I look at the sea, it just makes me feel so uneasy, I cannot understand why...”
「どこまでも続く広い海を見ていると、この世界の中で一人ぼっちのような気になってしまうんだ……」=“When I look at the wide open expanse stretching out like this, it just makes me feel so alone in this world...”
「はは、情けない話だろう？　少し幻滅させてしまったか？」=“Hahah, quite the pathetic thing, no? I suppose you must be a bit disillusioned with me now?”
「いや、全然。俺だって一人ぼっちで海を見てたらちょっと切なくなりそうだし」=“No, not at all. It'd probably make me feel pretty lonely too, looking out at a sight like this by myself.”
「でも、今は違うよね？」=“You don't feel that way anymore, right?”
「ああ、我等はもう一人ぼっちでは無いからな。隣に貴殿がいる、それだけでこんなに海が違って見えるとは……」=“Aah, since we are no longer alone. To think the view seems so different to me, just by having you by my side...”
「俺も同じだよ。海だけじゃなくて、[H名]と一緒だと何処にいても楽しいって思える」=“I feel the same way. And it's not just the sea, when you're with me, I can enjoy myself just about anywhere.”
「でも、折角なら海らしいことをしたいのではないか？」=“However, rather than these things, do you not wish to do activities more befitting of this place?”
「まぁね、砂のお城とか作ってみる？」=“Sure, wanna try making a sandcastle or something?”
「おお、それはいいな。我は城の造りには詳しいぞ」=“Ooh, that sounds quite nice. I do know a thing or two about castle design myself.”
「じゃあ、二人の理想の城を作ろうよ」=“Then, let's make our ideal castle together.”
「よし、任せてくれ。まずはどれくらいの大きさにするかだな、それによって防備の規模と配置が決まってくる」=“Alright, leave it to me. Firstly, we'll have to decide on the size of it, that would decide the scale and placement of the defenses.”
「どうせなら大きいのが作りたいなぁ」=“Well if we're making one, I wanna make something big~”
「賛成だ。しかしあまり大きいと迷惑になりそうだな……制作にも時間がかかってしまうし」=“I do agree. However, we cannot make it too big, lest it start being a bother... not to mention it will take more time the bigger it is.”
「うーん、じゃあ今日はアイディア出しだけにしようか？」=“Nnn, how about we just plan it out for today then?”
「そうだな。貴殿の理想の城がどんなものか聞かせてくれ」=“Right. Do tell me, just what sort of castle is your ideal castle?”
「俺は[H名]とゆっくりできる寝室が欲しいな。城のてっぺんとか、景色の良い所にさ」=“One with a bedroom where we can truly take our time with each other. At the top of the castle, with a nice view.”
「い、いきなり寝室の話か……まぁ、大事な場所ではあるが……」=“G-Going straight for that, are you... well, it is an important part of it...”
「こういう海沿いの岬とかにさ、大きな城を作って住めたら最高だろうね」=“It'd be just the best, to live in a castle on the cape of a sea like this, wouldn't it?”
「ああ、正に理想だな。城の天守で、貴殿と朝から夜まで変わる海の景色を見ていたい……」=“Aah, truly that would be the ideal. A life where we observe the rolling tide, from sun rise to sun set, from the top of the castle towers...”
