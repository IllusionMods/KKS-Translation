「お土産屋さんて……観光になってるかな？　もっと違う場所の方が良かった？」=“I wonder if the souvenir shops are ...... tourist attractions.　Would you have preferred a different place?”
「いや、良いと思うぞ。場所によってお土産の売り方も様々だ。その違いを見るだけで十分楽しめる」=“No, I think it's good. Souvenirs are sold in different ways in different places. Just looking at the differences is enough for me to enjoy.”
「へぇ、そういう見方もあるんだね。[H名]ってなんか、旅人みたいだね」=“I see how you look at it. [H名] is like a traveler.”
「我が旅人か……言い得て妙だな。きっと貴殿は場所より人の観察に長けているのだろう」=“My fellow travelers. ......, that's aptly put. Perhaps you are better at observing people than places.”
「確かにそうかも。女の子の微妙な変化とかにはよく気付く方だし」=“I think you're right. I'm the kind of person who notices subtle changes in girls.”
「はは、普通ならただのナンパ男の台詞だが……それだけはっきり言えれば大したものだ」=“Ha, it's usually just a pick-up line from a guy, but ...... it's a big deal if you can say it that clearly.”
