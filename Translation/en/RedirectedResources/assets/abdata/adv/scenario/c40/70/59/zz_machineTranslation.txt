「うぁあっ、おっぱい……！」=“Ooooh, boobs ......!”
「こら、起きたらまずはおはようだろう？　おっぱいは挨拶ではないぞ？」=“Hey, you know what the first thing you do when you wake up is to say good morning, right?　Tits are not a greeting, okay?”
「でも、だって……[H名]のおっぱいが……」=“But because ... [H名]'s tits are ...”
「ああ、先に起きていた貴殿のものに挨拶をしていたところだ……こっちはきちんとお辞儀もできるいい子だぞ」=“Yeah, I was just saying hi to your stuff that was up earlier. ...... This is a nice girl who can even bow properly.”
