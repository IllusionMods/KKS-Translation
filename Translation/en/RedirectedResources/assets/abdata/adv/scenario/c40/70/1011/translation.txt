「凄いね、こんな豪華な部屋で過ごせるなんて夢みたいだ」=“Amazing, to think we can spend a night in a room like this, it's like a dream.”
「ああ、まるで王族にでもなったようだな」=“Aah, almost feels as though we're royalty.”
「うんうん、ほんと何もかも大きくて豪華で王様って感じ」=“Yepyep, everything's just so big and fancy, it makes me feel like a king.”
「最早、部屋と呼ぶには大きすぎるな。軽く散歩でもできそうだ」=“It is almost too big to even call it a room. We could even go for a short walk in this place.”
「なら、二人で散歩する？　プールで泳ぐとかでもいいよ」=“Wanna do just that then? We could also go for a dip in the pool too.”
「いや、我はここでいい。豪華な部屋で過ごすより、外で控えている方が性に合っている」=“No, I am fine right here. Rather than spending time in a room like that, it suits me better to simply stay out here instead.”
「そっか……じゃあ俺も一緒に……」=“I see... then, maybe I'll join...”
「貴殿は色々見てきてもいいのだぞ。折角これだけの部屋に来たのだ、無理して我に付き合う必要は無い」=“Feel free to go take a look as you please. We've come to a place such as this, you needn't waste this chance on keeping me company.”
「別に無理はしてないよ。どんな豪華な部屋より、大好きな彼女の隣にいたいってだけ」=“I mean, it's not like I'd be wasting it. I'd rather be next to my cute girlfriend than in some fancy room.”
「なっ……また貴殿はそうして我をからかって……」=“Wha--... you never miss a chance to tease me, do you...”
「はは、でもほんとに俺が一人で行っちゃったら寂しかったでしょう？」=“Hahah. If actually left though, wouldn't you have felt lonely?”
「それは、まぁ……結局のところついていってしまっただろうな……」=“That's, well... I would have probably ended up just following you in...”
「あー、いいね。俺の後ろをちょこちょこついてくる[H名]とか可愛すぎる」=“Aah, I'd have liked to see that. The sight of you quietly toddling behind me would have been too cute.”
「そ、そうか？　普段だって、貴殿の後ろをついて歩くことはあるだろう？」=“T-That so? Do I not usually follow you from behind, though?”
「いやいや、[H名]って普段は用心棒みたいに自信満々な感じでついてくるからさ……」=“No no, usually you do that full of pomp though, like a bouncer keeping the area clear for me...”
「寂しくなってちょこちょこついてきちゃうってのが、凄く可愛いポイントなんだよ」=“The part where you would have quietly and restlessly followed me from behind would have been the real gamechanger.”
「むぅ……やはり散歩はやめよう。大きな部屋だからと歩き回るのは少々品性に欠ける……」=“Muh... let us not take a walk afterall. Taking a walk around it simply because it is big does feel a bit undignified...”
「はは、そうだね。じゃあ乾杯して、上品な時間を楽しもうか」=“Hahah, yeah. Then let's toast each other instead and enjoy a dignified time together, hm?”
「うむ、乾杯だ……貴殿と我の素敵な時間に……」=“Umu, here's to our wonderful time together... cheers...”
「うん、乾杯……でも流石だね、そういう乾杯の口上とかスラっと出てきちゃうんだから」=“Yep, cheers... but, I'm pretty amazed, you really do say that sort of stuff without the slightest bit of shyness.”
「[H名]はこういう部屋似合ってると思うよ。実際、女王様みたいなところあるしね」=“I think a room like this fits you, [H]. I mean, you do have that queen sort of side too, you know?”
「なにっ、我が女王？　それは流石におだて過ぎだろう……」=“What--, me, a queen? Even for you, that is too much flattery...”
「そうかな？　[H名]が女王様だったら、俺なら喜んで仕えちゃうけど」=“You think so? If you were my queen, I'd gladly serve you, [H].”
「むぅぅ……仕える、なのか？　我が女王なら、貴殿は王様……ではないのか？」=“Muuh... serve me, you say? If I were the queen, would you... not be my king?”
「えっ、それこそ俺が王様とか……調子に乗り過ぎじゃない？」=“Eh--, let me flip your own words to you... me, a king?”
「はは、二人とも大分この部屋の雰囲気に当てられてしまっているな。分相応という言葉を思い出そう」=“Hahah, seems that we're both getting quite affected by the atmosphere of this place. We ought to remember our means.”
「だね……でもさ、ちょっと憧れるよね。こういう豪華な部屋で二人で暮らせたらって……」=“Yeah... but, it's a bit dreamy, isn't it? If we could someday spend our lives in a place like this...”
「まぁ、そういう夢が無いと言えば嘘になるが……我は貴殿と一緒に居られるなら、場所は何処だっていい」=“Well, it would be a lie if I were to say I do not have such dreams, however... as long as I can be by your side, I care not where it is.”
「何処にいるかより、誰といるかが重要だと。貴殿の剣となってからは、常々そう感じている」=“The place matters not, what does matter is who you are with. Especially now that I am your sword, I cannot help but ruminate on that.”
「[H名]……ありがとう、俺は幸せ者だね」=“[H]... thank you, I really am a lucky guy, aren't I?”
「いつか……俺が頑張って本当にこういう部屋に住めるようになったらさ、その時は……」=“Someday... once I make it through the world and actually have the means to live in a place like this, would you...”
「ああ、できることなら我も傍に置いて欲しい……邪魔にならぬよう、部屋の隅に控えているから」=“Aah, if possible, I would like for you to take me along with you... I shall but take up a corner, as to not be a bother.”
「うーん。そこは隅っこじゃなくて、できれば俺の隣に居て欲しかったんだけど……」=“Nnnn. Personally, I'd prefer it if you could be at my side at that time, rather than taking up just a corner...”
「う、うむ……確かに、これだけ広い部屋だと離れていては貴殿を守り切れないかもしれないからな……」=“U-Umu... certainly, with a room this wide, it would be quite the endeavour to protect you from a distance...”
「[H名]……今は二人きりなんだし、もう少し素直に言って欲しいな」=“[H]... it's just us here right now, so I'd love it if you could be more honest.”
「うぅ……分かった。我はいつでも貴殿の傍にいたい……大好きな人と、片時も離れたくないんだ」=“Uu... I got it. I wish to be by your side, always... I love you so much, I do not wish for us to be separated even for a moment.”
「うん、俺も……ちょっとこの部屋は、俺達には広すぎたかもね」=“Yep, me too... this room is, a bit too wide for the two of us, isn't it?”
「ふふ、そうだな。たまにこうして楽しませてもらう程度が、我等には丁度いいのかもしれない」=“Fufuh, indeed. Just savouring it together like this every so often, might be more than enough for us.”
