「あ、見て！　ハリセンボンがいる」=“Oh, look!　There's the Harisenbon.”
「ああ、棘はまだ寝ているな。ストレスなく泳げている証拠だ」=“'Ah, the thorns are still sleeping. Proof of a stress-free swim.”
「できれば膨らんでるところが見たかったなぁ……」=“I would have liked to have seen it swollen if I could have. ......”
「そう言ってやるな。膨らむのは緊急時の防衛体勢なのだ、普段から棘を立てていたら疲れてしまうだろう」=“Don't say that. The bulging is a defensive posture in case of emergency; you'd get tired of standing on your spines on a regular basis.”
「そっか……でも膨らんでる姿って可愛いよね」=“I see... ...... but it's still cute to see them puffed up.”
「はは、確かにな。本人は精一杯威嚇しているつもりなのだろうが」=“Ha, indeed. I'm sure he thinks he's being as intimidating as possible.”
「うんうん、怒ってても可愛いとか……誰かさんと一緒だね」=“Yeah, just like someone who's cute even when they're angry or ...... someone.”
「なっ、我は別に膨らんだりしないぞ？」=“I'm not bloated, am I?”
「ほら、ちょっと膨らんだ。もう水槽に入れてずっと見てたいくらい可愛いよ」=“Look, it's a little puffy. It's so cute, I want to put it in the tank and look at it all the time.”
「むぅぅ……我は魚ではなくて貴殿の恋人だぞ。水槽などに入れなくても、ずっと見たければ好きにすればいい」=“I'm not a fish, I'm your lover. You don't have to put me in a tank or anything, you can look at me all the time if you want.”
「ほんと？　じゃあ、ジー……」=“Really?　Then gee ......”
「ぐ……い、今は魚を見ろ！　ほら、ハリセンボンが膨らんできたぞ！」=“G......Yes, now look at the fish!　Look, the echidna is swelling up!”
「えっ、それは見たい！　おお、ほんとに膨らんでる！」=“What? I'd like to see that!　Oh, it's really swollen!”
「なんでいきなり膨らんだんだろうね？　近くに大きい魚が来たとかかな？」=“Why did it suddenly swell up?　Maybe a big fish came nearby?”
「知らん。我らが騒いでいたからではないか？　うるさくてかなわんと言ってるのかもしれないぞ」=“I don't know. Is it because we were making a lot of noise?　Maybe he's saying it's too loud.”
「え……こっちも大分、膨らんじゃってる？」=“What's the matter, ...... this one's pretty swollen, too?”
「ああ、誰かさんがからかい過ぎるせいでな。棘も立っているから近付かない方がいいぞ？」=“Yeah, because someone's making too much fun of me. You'd better stay away from him because he's a thorn in your side, too.”
「ごめんて……ギューって抱き締めたらしぼんでくれる？」=“If I hug you sorry ......, will you squeeze me?”
「なっ、待て！　だから棘が立っていると言っているだろう？　そんなものを抱き締めたら痛いぞ？」=“Wait a minute!　I told you that there are thorns standing in the way, didn't I?　How painful would it be to hug something like that?”
「ちょっと痛いくらいは我慢するよ。それで[H名]の機嫌が直るなら安いものだし」=“I'll put up with a little pain. If it can fix [H名]'s mood, it's a small price to pay.”
「まったく、貴殿には敵わんな。別に本当に怒っていたわけじゃない……ほら、もうハリセンボンもしぼんだようだぞ」=“I am no match for you, he said. I wasn't really angry. ...... Look, it seems that Harisenbon has already wilted.”
