「うん、本気だよ。俺は[H名]が大好きで、付き合いたいと思ってる！」=“Yep, I am. I love you tons and, I just want you to go out with me!”
「わ、分かった。そう何度も言わずとも……貴殿の気持ちは伝わっている」=“G-Got it. You needn't say it so many times... your feelings have already made their way to me.”
「じゃあ……ＯＫってことかな？」=“Then... is that a yes?”
「そ、そう取ってもらって構わない。いや、こういう返事の仕方は失礼だな……少し待ってくれ……」=“I-I do not mind if you take it that way. No, that is incredibly rude of me, that's not what I... do wait a moment...”
「うん、いくらでも待つよ……」=“Yep, I'll wait as long as it takes...”
「貴殿の思い、しかと受け取った。ありがとう……これからは我を貴殿の剣として、傍に置いてくれ……」=“I have received your feelings for me. Thank you... keep me by your side forevermore, as your partner, as your blade...”
「[H名]……ありがとう。これで俺達、恋人同士だね」=“[H]... thank you. With this, we're a couple.”
