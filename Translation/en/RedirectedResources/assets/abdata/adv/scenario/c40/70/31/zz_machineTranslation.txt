「パワースポットとかって信じる方？」=“Do you believe in power spots?”

「ちょっと意外だね。[H名]は自分の剣以外は信じない！　とか言うかと思ってた」=“It's a little surprising, he said. [H名] doesn't believe in anything but her own sword!　I thought you would say something like that.”
「待て待て、貴殿の中の我のイメージはそんな風なのか？　まぁ確かに、完全に否定はできないが……」=“Wait, wait, wait, is that your image of me?　Well, sure, I can't deny that completely. ......”
「はは、悪いイメージじゃないから安心して」=“Ha, don't worry, it's not a bad image.”
「むしろ、パワースポット好きとか、意外に乙女チックなところも可愛いなーって思ったから」=“I thought it was rather cute that she liked power spots and was surprisingly maidenly.”
「なっ、こらっ！　からかうな！　まったく……真剣に答えて損をした」=“Hey, come on!　Don't play with me!　I totally ...... lost out on a serious answer.”
（照れてる照れてる。そういうところがまた可愛いんだよな……）=(She's embarrassed. She's embarrassed. That's what's so cute about him. ......)
