「そこから？」=“And that's it?”
「運動は全般的に苦手なの……コートに線があるけど、どこに入れば点になるのかな……」=“I'm not very good at sports in general. ...... There's a line on the court, where do I put the dots? ......”
「ルールとか、あんまり難しく考えなくていいよ。楽しめれば勝ちだから」=“Don't think too hard about the rules. Don't think too hard about the rules, as long as you have fun, you win.”

「それじゃあ、よろしくね？」=“All right, then?”
「そろそろ休憩にしようか？　思ったよりも盛り上がったね」=“Let's take a break, shall we?　This is more fun than I thought it would be.”
「ふうっ、疲れるよりも肩が凝っちゃった」=“Phew, my shoulders are more stiff than tired.”

「そう？　それならよかった」=“Yeah?　That's good.”
「うん、たまにだったらまた付き合ってもいいよ。……下手でも笑わないでくれるなら」=“I think I like you a lot more than I used to." "Yeah, I'd be happy to go out with you again if it's just once in a while. Yeah, I'd be happy to go out with you again sometimes, if you don't laugh when I'm bad at .......”
