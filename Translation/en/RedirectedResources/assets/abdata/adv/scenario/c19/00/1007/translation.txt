「わあ、キレイ」=“Wah, it's so pretty.”
「本当だね。水の中なのにたくさんの色があって、なんだか……」=“It really is. To think the water would be so colorful inside, it's almost...”
「海の世界をそのまま水槽に切り出したみたいだね」=“It's almost like a slice of the sea was taken and put into a fish tank as is, isn't it?”
「う、うん、俺もそんなようなこと言おうと思ってた」=“Y-Yeah, I was thinking of basically the same thing.”
「ふふ、知ってる？　海って現代でもまだ解明されてない、たくさんの謎があるんだって」=“Fufuh, did you know? The sea's still not been understood fully by humanity, even in the modern day. There's tons of still unresolved mysteries.”

「……海底人の王国が？」=“...Maybe a country made of seapeople?”

「[P名]君は私のこういう変なお話も楽しそうに聞いてくれるからかな」=“I wonder if it's because you always seem to enjoy and care about whatever I have to say?”
「本当に面白くて聞いてるだけだよ。他は？　どんな謎があるの？」=“I enjoy it because it's interesting. And? What else do we not know?”
「そうだね、たとえば……」=“Let's see, for example...”
