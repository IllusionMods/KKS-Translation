「すごい、海が煌めいてる……」=“Amazing, the sea's twinkling...”
「海ほたるだよ。すごいね、[H名]……得しちゃった」=“It's sea fireflies. It's amazing, isn't it, [H名]... we really lucked out.”
「…………………………」=“...”
「[H名]？」=“[H名]?”
「いつも本ばかり読んでいるのに、ダメだね……私ったら」=“I've always got my head stuck in books, and yet... I'm no good, am I?”
「目の前の光景に圧倒されてしまったの。頭の中が真っ白になって、何も……言葉が出てこない」=“I feel completely overwhelmed right now. My head feels blank, I can't... come up with any words at all.”
「星空の色を海に写したみたい？　……ううん」=“Almost feels like the sea's taken on the color of the starry sky? ...No, that's not it.”
「どんな言葉で飾り立てようとしても、私の目に映ってる……この光景には負けちゃうのがわかるの」=“No matter what sort of words I try to use, I just know... in front of this sight, they're nothing, they can't win.”
「そういうのはきっと、勝ち負けとかそういうものじゃないと思う」=“I don't think it's a matter of really winning or losing against anything here.”
「『この時の作者の気持ちを述べよ』みたいな問題があったりするけど、そんなの無茶な話でさ」=“Questions like "state what the author felt at this point" are very common but, that's just unreasonable to begin with.”
「わからないから想像するんだし、想像するから楽しいんじゃないかな」=“We imagine those things because we can't know, and we do it because it's fun, no?”
「……美しいものを美しいと作者が書いてても、本当にそう感じているかはわからない？」=“...Even if the author says in their words that something is beautiful, you're saying that we can't know if they really feel that way?”
「うん、本当の気持ちはそれを書いたその人だけのものだから」=“Yep, since the real feelings belong to the author of those words and to them alone.”
「このキレイな海の流れ星をどう感じたかは、どんな言葉でも、たとえ言葉にできなくたって[H名]のものだよね」=“Your feelings towards seeing all these stars within this beautiful sea are yours, no matter what sorts of words you use, even if you can't use any words at all.”
「キレイだなって感じたら、もうその時点で勝ち負けを言うなら[H名]の勝ちだよ」=“As long as you're feeling the beauty, if it has to be about winning and losing then you win at that point automatically, no?”
「……海の流れ星。ふふ♪　ちょっと素敵な表現かも」=“...The stars within the sea, huh? Fufuh♪ That's a pretty lovely expression.”
「俺そんなこと言ってた？」=“Did I say that?”
「うん。言ってたよ、飾らない……心が感じたそのままの言葉って感じがした」=“Yep, you did. And it didn't feel fake... it felt like it came right out of your heart.”
「そうだね。勝ち負けじゃないものね」=“You're right. It's not about winning or losing, is it?”
「別に言葉にしようとすることを否定したわけじゃないよ？　そういうのだって楽しみ方だし」=“It's not like I was saying that you were wrong to try and put it into words though, okay? I mean, that's a way of enjoying this stuff too.”
「その、[H名]らしいと思うから」=“And uhm, I think it's very much like you, [H名].”
「……そんなこと言われたら、創作意欲に火がついちゃいそう」=“...You're gonna make my desire to write flare up, you know.”
「あはは、詩でも作る？」=“Ahahah, gonna write a song?”
「試してみようかな。[P名]君が笑わないって約束してくれるのなら」=“I just might. If you promise not to laugh, [P名]-kun.”
「それと、海ほたるがまだもうちょっとの間だけ……この場所で煌めいていてくれるならかな？」=“Also, if the sea fireflies... keep twinkling for a bit longer for me, I guess?”
「どうだろうね？　海ほたるの機嫌はわからないけど」=“Who knows? It's not like we can tell what they're gonna do.”
「笑ったりはしないよ。それは絶対に」=“But I won't laugh. That I can guarantee.”
「……好き」=“...I love you.”
「え？　そ、それは……もう詩が始まってるのかな」=“Eh? T-That's... is that part of the poem?”
「ううん、これはただの私の気持ち」=“Nope, that's just how I feel.”
「……海ほたるが海の流れ星なら、この気持ちは流れ星への誓いみたいに空に届いたのかな」=“...If the sea fireflies are the stars within the sea then, do you think these feelings of mine reached to the stars like a wish?”
（もう詩になってるような……）=(I feel like this is already turning pretty poetic...)
「眩しいくらい。この輝きが天の川なら、私達は織姫と彦星だね」=“It's almost dazzling. If we take this to be the milky way, I'd be Orihime and you the Hikoboshi of this story, wouldn't we?”
「こんな幸せな時間が一年に一回だけじゃ嫌だなぁ」=“I'd rather not be, personally. It'd suck pretty bad only being able to see each other once a year~”
「ふふふふっ♪　うん、本当にそうだね」=“Fufufufuh~♪ Yeah, it'd suck really bad.”
