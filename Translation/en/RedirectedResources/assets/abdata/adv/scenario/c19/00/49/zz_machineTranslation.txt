「こういうご当地の家庭料理って、滅多に食べられないから嬉しいよね」=“It's nice to have this kind of local home-cooked food because you don't get to eat it often.”
「うん……それに、どの料理も美味しいから、ご飯の時間が楽しいの」=“Yeah. ...... And all the food is delicious, so dinner time is fun.”
「それはよかった。珍しい料理が多いけど、苦手な食べ物ってないの？」=“That's good to know. There are many unusual dishes, but are there any foods you don't like?”
「今のところはないかな。さすがに色物的な料理は遠慮したいけど……」=“I don't think so at the moment. I don't think so. I don't want to do anything too sexy. ......”
「色物といえば、ヤギの金玉を食べるってきいたことがあるよ」=“Speaking of sexy, I've heard of eating goat balls.”
「……偏見はよくないって分かってるんだけど、やっぱり遠慮したいな」=“...... I know I shouldn't be prejudiced, but I'd rather not.”
