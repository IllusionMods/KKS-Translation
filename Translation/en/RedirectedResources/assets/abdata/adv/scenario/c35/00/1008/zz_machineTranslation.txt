「わぁぁ……流れ星、綺麗やねぇ！　こんなにたくさん見えるっちゃね」=“Wow, ......, those shooting stars are so beautiful!　I can see so many of them.”
「私、流れ星って好きなんよ。すっごく長い間、宇宙を旅してきて……今、私たちの前で輝いてくれとっちゃもん」=“I love shooting stars. I like shooting stars because they have traveled through the universe for a very long time and are now shining in front of us at .......”
「確かに……そこまで考えるとロマンチックだね」=“Sure, ......, it's romantic to think about it that way.”
「やろ？　こういうの、好きな人と一緒に見られるだけで幸せやない？　やけん……ふふっ、君と見られて嬉しい」=“You know what?　I'm sure you'll be happy to know that you can watch these things with someone you love.　I'm happy to watch it with you.”
「あはは、俺だって同じだよ。こんなに綺麗な星空……[H名]と見られて嬉しい」=“Haha, it's the same for me. I'm glad to see such a beautiful starry sky ... with [H名].”
「本当？　あはは、だったらますます幸せ♪　あの光の一つ一つがどのくらいの旅をしてきたか……一緒に思いを馳せてみよ？」=“Really?　Haha, then I'm even happier. ...... Let's think together about how far each of those lights has traveled, shall we?”
（流れ星の旅かぁ……[H名]らしい考え方だな）=(A shooting star trip... That's a very [H名]an way of thinking.)
「ここまで来るには色々な星の近くを通ってきたんだろうね」=“We must have passed by a lot of stars to get here.”
「うん……どこで生まれたかは分からんけど……きっと色んなものを見てきたとよ。で、今こうやってキラキラしとる……」=“I don't know ...... where you were born, but I'm sure ...... you've seen a lot of things. And now you're shining like this .......”
「なんか……自分勝手な考え方やけど……私たちのために光ってくれとるみたいな気にならん？」=“It's kind of ...... selfish, but doesn't it feel like ...... it's glowing for us?”
「あはは、この雰囲気……広い空を二人占めしてる感じだもんね。分からなくもないかも……」=“Haha, this atmosphere ...... is like having the whole sky to yourself. I guess I can understand that. ......”
「[H名]って……本当に流れ星が好きなんだね」=“[H名] really likes ... shooting stars, doesn't she?”
「うん、大好き……私の実家ね、ばり田舎やけん……小さい頃から結構よく見とったと」=“Yeah, I love it. ...... My parents live in a very rural area. ...... You've seen a lot of it since you were little.”
「……って言っても、ここまで多くはないけど……でも、空を見上げとったら、大体一つ二つは見えとったかな」=“There aren't that many ......, but if you look up at the sky, you'll probably see one or two.”
「もしかして……その度に願い事してたり？」=“Maybe ...... you're making a wish every time?”
「あははっ、無理無理ー！　流れ星って一瞬なんやもん。あれって確か、三回唱えんといかんっちゃろ？」=“Hahaha, I can't!　A shooting star is only for a moment. I think you have to chant it three times, don't you?”
「願い事って……ただでさえいっぱいあるのに……三回も唱えるとか絶対無理やない？」=“There are so many wishes, and it's impossible to say them three times.”
「それは俺もそう思うけど……でもチャレンジはしたでしょ？」=“That's what I think, too, but you've tried ......, right?”
「そうやね。小さな頃はしとったよ。でも……私の願い事って、どれも簡単には叶わんものばかりやけん……」=“That's right. I did it when I was little. But ...... all my wishes don't come true so easily. ......”
「そうなの？　例えばどんなこと？」=“Really?　What do you do?”
「うーん……そうやねぇ……例えば、動物と話せますように……とか？　あはは、そう簡単には実現できそうにないやろ？」=“Hmmm... ......Well, ......maybe you can talk to animals ......?　Haha, that's not going to be easy to achieve, is it?”
「おお、それは確かに難しいかも……」=“Oh, that's gonna be tough. ......”
「そうやろー。でもね……簡単やないけん、願い甲斐があるんやないかなぁ……とも思うっちゃん」=“That's true. But you know, I think it's worth ...... wishing for because it's not easy.”
「簡単に叶う願い事なら、流れ星にお願いせんでも……努力すれば叶えられるけん……」=“If it's an easy wish, you don't have to ask a shooting star to make it come true. ...... You can make it come true if you try hard enough.”
「あっ、でもね、小さな頃に願ったことで……一つ、叶ったことがあるかも……」=“Oh, but you know, there was one thing I wished for when I was little that came true: ......”
「えっ、本当！？　どんなこと？」=“Oh, really?　What do you mean?”
「ふふーっ、さて、どげんことでしょう？」=“Well, what do you think?”
「えー、まさか教えてくれないのー！？」=“Oh, you're not going to tell me?”
「ごめんごめん、冗談よ。あのね……ちょっとだけ恥ずかしいっちゃけど……」=“Sorry, sorry, just kidding. I'm sorry, I'm kidding. ...... I'm just a little embarrassed. ......”
「いつか大好きな人と一緒に、流れ星を見られますように……ほらー、もう叶ったやろ？　えへへ」=“May you see a shooting star with the one you love someday. ...... See, it already happened, didn't it?　Heh heh heh.”
