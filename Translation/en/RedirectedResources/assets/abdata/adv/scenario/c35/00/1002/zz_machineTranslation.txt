「卓球台があるよ！　やってみない？」=“There's a ping-pong table!　You wanna play?”
「あはっ、卓球とかばり久しぶり！　よーし、ここは真剣勝負やね！」=“It's been too long since I played ping-pong.　Okay, let's play some serious games here!”
「ははっ、それじゃお手柔らかにお願いします」=“Haha, please be gentle with me then.”
「えへへっ、こちらこそお手柔らかにお願いするん。あ、でも手加減は無用やけんね！」=“Heh, please be gentle with me too. But don't go easy on me!”
「うん、もちろん！」=“Yeah, sure!”
「うぅ……負けたぁ……最初はうまくいっとったんに……あのミスさえなければ勝てたっちゃけどなぁ……」=“Ugh ...... I lost. ...... I was doing well at first. ...... I could have won if I hadn't made that mistake. ......”
「あはは、俺の方が運が良かったってとこかな」=“Haha, I guess I'm luckier than you.”
「でも君が本当に手を抜かんで勝負するとか……ちょっと意外やった。君ってこういうとき相手に気を遣いそうやもん」=“But I was a little surprised to see that you were really willing to cut corners and play the ...... game. I was a little surprised to see that you were really willing to play it safe.”
「そうかな？　でも真剣勝負って言ってたし、何より楽しかったから」=“I don't know.　I don't know. But you said it was a serious game, and more importantly, it was fun.”
「私も！　こげん楽しめるのって君とやからやと思う。君の前やとめっちゃ自然になれて。私が私でいられる感じがするけん」=“Me too!　I think it's because I'm with you that I can enjoy this. I feel so natural in front of you. I feel like I can be myself in front of you.”
「俺もだよ。変に気を遣わずに俺が俺でいられるっていうか……」=“Me too. I'd like to be able to be me without worrying about it. ......”
「な……なんか、改めて言われると照れる。でもこげん気持ちになれる人と巡る会えるとか……ばり幸せなことやんね」=“I'm so embarrassed when I hear it again. But it's ...... a blessing to meet someone who can make you feel this way.”
「あはは、こっちこそ……改めて言われると照れるよ」=“Haha, I'm embarrassed to hear you say that again at .......”
「えへへ。あのね……私を好きになってくれてありがとう。これからもよろしくね」=“Heh. You know, ......, thank you for liking me. Thank you for liking me and I look forward to working with you.”
