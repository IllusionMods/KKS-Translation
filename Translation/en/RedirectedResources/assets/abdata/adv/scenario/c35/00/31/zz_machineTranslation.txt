「灯台をこげん近くで見るのはここが初めてやったなぁ」=“This is the first time I've seen a lighthouse this close.”
「まあ、普通は近づかない場所だからねぇ」=“Well, it's not a place I'd normally go to.”
「実際近くで見ると、やっぱり迫力が違うなぁー」=“It's so much more powerful when you see it up close.”
「だね、素朴な作りなんだけど、こう、存在感の強さっていうのかな？」=“Yeah, it's rustic, but it's got a strong presence.”
「うん……なんかこう、君と一緒に見れてよかったなーって思う……」=“Yeah, ...... I'm kind of glad that I got to see it with you. ......”
