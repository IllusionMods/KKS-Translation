「わぁぁ！　水槽めっちゃ綺麗やん！　お魚たくさんおって、本当に海の中におるみたいな気になる！」=“Wow!　The tank is so beautiful!　There are so many fish, I feel like I'm really in the sea!”
「あっ、見て見て！　あれサメやない！？　こげんいっぱいお魚おるのに、一緒におって大丈夫とかいな？」=“Oh, look at that!　That's a shark!　I don't think it's safe for us to be together with all these fish.”
「本当だ。でも……意外と仲良さそうに泳いでない？」=“It's true. But don't they look surprisingly friendly swimming around in ......?”
「うん。他のお魚も気にしとらん感じ。へぇぇ、みんな怖くないんやねぇ……」=“Yes. The other fish don't seem to mind. Wow, you guys aren't afraid of .......”
「でもこれが本来の自然の姿なんかな？　必要以上に争うことはないっていうか……みんな仲間っていうか……」=“But is this the way nature is supposed to be?　There's no need to fight. ...... We're all friends. ......”
「あー、確かにそうかも。本能的に必要ないことで争うのって、人間だけかもしれないね」=“Oh, I guess you're right. Maybe it's only humans who instinctively fight over things they don't need to.”
「うん、そう考えると、この子たちってみんなすごいんやね。違う種族とも仲良くするっちゃもん」=“Yeah, when you think about it, all these girls are amazing. They get along well with different species.”
「自然って厳しいイメージがあるっちゃけど……この子たち見とると……実は優しいところもいっぱいあるんやなぁって思うよ」=“Nature is supposed to be harsh, but when I look at these girls, I realize that ...... there's a lot of kindness in it.”
「厳しいけど優しい……うん、そうだね。言えてるかも」=“She's strict but kind. ...... Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you could say that.”
「やろ？　ね、私たちもそういう関係になれたらいいと思わん？」=“Right?　Don't you think it would be nice if we could have that kind of relationship?”
「お互いに厳しくするところは厳しくして！　優しくするところは優しくして！　で、必要以上に争わんと！」=“Where we are strict with each other, we are strict!　Be nice to each other where you can!　And don't fight more than you have to!”
「あはは、時々は争うんだ？」=“Haha, do you fight sometimes?”
「それは……ほら、喧嘩するほど仲が良いとも言うやん？」=“That's ...... you see, they say the more you fight, the better you get along, right?”
「でもやっぱり……君とはできるだけ喧嘩したくないなぁ。優しいだけの関係でおりたいかも……えへへ」=“But I don't want to fight with you ...... as much as I can. I don't want to fight with you ...... as much as I can. I want to just be gentle with you ...... hehehe.”
「うん、俺も。喧嘩はあんまりしたくない。これからもずっと仲良しでいようね」=“Yeah, me too. I don't want to fight with you too much. I don't want to fight too much. We'll always be good friends, right?”
