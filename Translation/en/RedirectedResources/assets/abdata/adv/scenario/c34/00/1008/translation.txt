「Ｗｏｗ……ｆａｎｔａｓｔｉｃ……」=“Wow... Fantastic...”
「[H名]と一緒に見たかったんだ」=“I wanted to see this with you.”
「ウミホタル……英語でもＳｅａ　ｆｉｒｅｆｌｙって言うケド、本当にホタルみたい……」=“Sea fireflies... They're called sea fireflies but, they really are like fireflies...”
「ホタルが海で泳いで……ｌｅｔ　ｍｅ　ｓｅｅ……ダメ、コトバが出てこないヨ……」=“Fireflies swimming in the sea... let me see... No, I can't even think of words properly...”
「いや、この光景は言葉にできないよ……」=“You can't put this scenery in words even if you wanted to...”
「ウン……キレイ……」=“Yeah... it's so pretty...”
「…………」=“...”
「……デモ、イツカ……この思い出を、二人で懐かしがって話す時……その時は、コトバにしたいナ……」=“...But, someday... when we look back at this, and talk about it... I wanna, put it into words then...”
「イツになるかわからないケド、ニッポン語ペラペラになった時、話してもいいカナ？」=“I dunno how long it'll take but, do you mind if we talk about it again, when I get fluent at Japanese?”
「今日の、ウミホタル見たときのコト……」=“Talk about, what we've seen today...”
「もちろん。そのときのために、しっかり目に焼き付けておかないとね」=“Of course. And for the sake of that, we gotta burn this sight into our eyes today.”
「ウン……その時マデ、一緒にいてもらえるように、ワタシ頑張るヨ、ニッポン語も、アナタのカノジョも！」=“Yeah... I'll do my best, so that we can still be together, until that time comes, both at learning Japanese, and being your girlfriend!”
「いや、それは俺のセリフだよ。振られないように気を付けないとね」=“Nah, I should be saying that. I've gotta be careful, lest I get dumped.”
「ワタシがアナタを！？　Ｎｏｎ－ｎｏｎ－ｎｏｎ－ｎｏｎ！　振らないヨ、ｌｏｖｅ　ｌｏｖｅ　ｌｏｖｅ　ｌｏｖｅダヨ！」=“Me, dump you!? Non non non non! That'd never happen, I love love love love you!”
「いや、もちろん俺も振られる気はないけど、すれ違いとかがこじれたりとか、そういう話もいっぱい聞くから」=“No I mean, of course I don't think you would either but, sometimes misunderstandings pile up, I've heard of too many couples that break up due to that.”
「そうならないように気を付けたいと思ってさ」=“So I was just saying that I've gotta make sure that that doesn't happen between us.”
「Ｏｈ，そ、そうダヨネ、慌ててゴメンネ！」=“Oh, o-of course, sorry for panicking there!”
「いや、俺も言い方が悪かったね。こんなロマンチックなときに振られるとか」=“No, I didn't say it clearly either. I can't believe I'd bring up something like that in such a romantic moment.”
「ウウンッ！　ワタシもよく心配トカ不安になるカラ！　ワタシ、思ったことは何でも言ってホシイ！」=“Nuh-uh! I get very worried and anxious sometimes too! I want you to tell me whatever you feel, anytime you want to!”
「ア、デモ、何でもって言っても、強制トカじゃなくテ、言いたいケド、遠慮がいるコトトカ、遠慮しなくていいんダヨってコト」=“Ah, but, I'm not telling you to force yourself to do it or anything, I just mean that if it's something you don't think you should but want to, then you should just tell me anyway.”
「うん、しっかり伝わってるよ。それは[H名]が日本語ペラペラじゃなくても、ちゃんと言うようにする」=“Yep, I got what you said just fine. I'll always try to say what I want to say to you, even if you're not fluent at replying back just yet.”
「Ｏｗ……ワタシヤッパリ、コトバがイッパイイッパイなコト、ｃｏｍｐｌｅｘミタイ……焦ってるの、わかるヨ」=“Ow... I think big words are, a bit too complex for me still... I can tell, that I'm getting ahead of myself.”
「デモ、焦ってるってジカク……自覚したら大丈夫！　アナタとの大切な思い出、涙にしたりしないカラネ♡」=“But, as long as I know that I am... it'll be fine! I won't have our precious memories together, lead to any tears♡”
「うん……あー……俺もコトバにするの難しいけど……ちょっと待ってね……」=“Yeah... ah... It's hard for me to put this into words too but... just wait a second...”
「その、言葉も心も勘違いとか、すれ違いとかするけど、こうやって海ほたるを見た思い出は、違わないというか……」=“Erhm, we might misunderstand, or not understand each other's words and hearts but, this memory of us watching this sight together is, not a misunderstanding, or rather--”
「そう信じたい、わからないから……でも、[H名]とはずっと一緒にいたいから……ごめん、俺もうまく言えない……」=“I want to believe that, but I don't know... but, I want to be with you forever, [H名]... sorry, I can't properly say it either...”
「伝わってるヨ！　アナタの気持ち、表情トカ、言い方トカ、ｎｕａｎｃｅが伝わってくるノ！　キット、好き同士で付き合ってるカラ！」=“It's alright, I got it! I can feel your feelings, through your face, through your way of saying it, through the nuance! I bet it's because we love each other.”
「アナタと初めて会ってカラ、一回一回、一言一言、ｃｏｍｍｕｎｉｃａｔｉｏｎシテ、ダカラ伝わるヨ、アナタの気持ち♡」=“We've made sure to communicate every single thing, and every single word properly, ever since we met, that's why I can understand, how you feel♡”
「ソレがイチバン、不安取れる……なくなるカラ……伝えるの難しくテモ、モシ伝わらなくテモ……何とかして伝えようとするコトが大事なんダネ」=“That's what makes it the most... takes away the most anxiety... even if it's hard to get it through, and even if we can't... what's important is trying to do it, isn't it?”
「うん、俺もそう思う……今の俺たちはそれで行こう」=“Yeah, I think so too... Let's just go with that for us.”
「Ｙｅｓ♡　ソレジャ、あとはユックリ、ウミホタル一緒に見ヨッ♡　焼き付けるッ！」=“Yes♡ Well then, all that's left is to watch the sea fireflies more--♡ I'mma burn them into my eyes--!”
「だね」=“Yeah.”
（……こうやって無言で過ごせる時が増えたらいいな）=(...It'd be nice if we could spend more time like this in silence together.)
（いや……増やそう。何も言わなくても信頼し合えるような心地のいい時間を増やしてあげるんだ）=(Nah... I'll make it happen. I'll make it so that we can just rely on each other and feel comfortable in each other's presence even without having to say a thing.)
