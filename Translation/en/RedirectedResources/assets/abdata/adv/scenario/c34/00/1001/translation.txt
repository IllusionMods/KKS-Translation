「涼しそうだし、ここでゆっくりしようよ」=“This place seems pretty cool, let's take it easy here for a bit.”
「ン～、このＩｃｅ　ｂａｒオイシイネ♪」=“Nn~, this ice stick is really tasty, isn't it♪”
「縁側でアイスなんて粋だよね」=“Eating ice cream while relaxing at the veranda (engawa) is the peak of sophistication, isn't it?”
「Ｗｈａｔ？　エンガワ？　オスシの？」=“What? Engawa? You mean sushi?”
「あ～、それは……って、何が違うんだろう。調べてみるよ」=“Ah~, that's... hmm, I wonder why it's called that. I'll check.”
「えーと……あ、ヒラメの筋肉の形が縁側みたいだからそう呼ぶんだって」=“Erhm... ah, a flounder's muscles kinda look like a porch, so that's why it's called that.”
「ヒラメ？　エンガワって、お魚の名前違うノ？」=“Flounder? Is the fish called differently from the meat?”
「あー……魚の名前はヒラメなんだけど、ネタとしての名前はえんがわなんだよ」=“Ah... yeah, the fish is called flounder but as an ingredient it's called engawa.”
「Ｈｍｍ～……ニッポンゴって難しいヨネ、ｎｉｃｋｎａｍｅてコト？」=“Hmm~... Japanese is so hard, is it a nickname?”
「そうそう。魚自体は縁側に似てないけど、ネタとしてはちょっとゴツゴツしてるここの床に似てるよね」=“Yeah, basically. The fish itself doesn't look anything even remotely close to it but, the meat kinda looks rough and grainy like the wood we're standing on.”
「Ｉ Ｓｅｅ　デモ、Ｉｃｅ　ｂａｒはＩｃｅ　ｂａｒなんダネ」=“I see, but, this ice stick is still an ice stick, huh?”
「そのまんまだね。アイスバーって、[H名]が住んでた国にもあったの？」=“Yep, that's just one-to-one. Do they have those back where you live too?”
「Ｙｅａｈ，アッチだと、アイスは……ンー……ｅｓｓｅｎｔｉａｌ……ヒツヨウ、フカケツ……？」=“Yeah, back there, ice cream is... nnn...「essential」... important, indispensible...?”
「へぇ、そんなに？　なくちゃならないものって感じ？」=“Hoh, that much, huh? Is it something you can't do without?”
「Ｓｏ！　ナクチャナラナイモノ。ダカラ、Ｉｃｅ　ｂａｒもイッパイ、あるヨ！」=“Exactly! Something we can't do without. So we've got lots of them, over there!”
「そっか。でも海外の人ってよくアイス食べるイメージあるな～」=“I see. But I guess that makes sense, foreigners do have that sort of image, of consuming a ton of ice cream, you know~”
「コドモも、オトナも、Ｉｃｅがダイスキ♪　家の近くマデ、Ｉｃｅのｔｒｕｃｋ来るカラ！」=“It's loved by both kids and adults♪ Ice cream trucks come all the way to your home back there!”
「アイスのトラックって、移動販売車ってことか」=“Ice cream trucks, huh? Guess you mean one of those food trucks?”
「Ｙｅｓ♪　ワタシもトモダチとイッパイ食べたヨ♪」=“Yes♪ I also used to eat lots of ice cream with my friends♪”
「いいな～。この島にも独特な文化とか風習があるけど、[H名]の育った国の生活も興味あるよ」=“Sounds nice~, this island's got its own unique culture and practices but, I'm really interested in the culture of your country too.”
「オトナになったら、ふたりで研修旅行スル？」=“Wanna go on our own little research trip, once we become adults?”
「あはは、研修じゃなくて普通の旅行でいいけどね」=“Ahahah, it doesn't have to be for research. We could just go on a normal trip.”
「ＯＫ♪　アナタが気に入ったら、ｓｗｅｅｔ　ｈｏｍｅを作ってもイイネ♡」=“OK♪ And if you like it there, we could make our own little sweet home there too♡”
「スイートホームって、一緒に住むってこと？」=“To live together?”
「Ｙｕｐ♡　モチロン、ケッコンしてからダケドネ♡　フフッ、Ｉ　ｃａｎ’ｔ　ｗａｉｔ♪　楽しみ～♪」=“Yup♡ Of course, we'll have to get married first♡ Fufuh--, I can't wait for it♪ At all~♪”
