「わぁぁ……すごっ……！」=“Waah... amazing--...!”
「……流れ星」=“...It's shooting stars.”
「うん！　そう、そうなんだけど」=“Yeah! It is, it sure is.”
「ここまでだと、流れ星とかそういうのじゃなくない？　シャワーじゃん」=“Would you even call this "shooting" though? It's just a shower at this point.”
「ずーっと流れてる」=“It just keeps going on and on.”
「だね……」=“Yeah...”
「あは、見惚れちゃうね」=“Ahah, it's so captivating.”
「[H名]の目にも星が映ってるよ。本当にすごいな……流れ星で空が明るいのなんて初めてだ」=“I can see them in your eyes too. It's seriously amazing... it's the first time I've even heard of shooting stars lighting up a night like this.”
「写真撮ろうかな……ううん、そんなの味気ないか。後で見てもかえって『こんなだったっけ』とか思っちゃいそう」=“Maybe we should take a picture... no, I guess that'd just be tasteless. Even if we look at it later, I feel like it's gonna feel like less, a lot less.”
「二人で覚えとけばいいよね？」=“We just gotta remember it together, don't we?”
「うん、ずっと覚えてよう」=“Yeah, let's remember this forever.”
「だね……あ！　そうだ、お願いしないと」=“Yeah... Ah! Right, we gotta make our wishes.”
「[P名]くんは？　とっくに流れ星に何かお願いした後だったりするのかな」=“Have you already made your wish or something, [P名]-kun?”
「……んー？」=“...Nn?”
「なんでも願い放題だよ。流れ星、まだ全然止まりそうにないし」=“We can make as many wishes as we want. I mean, the stars aren't slowing at all still.”
「アタシも何か……うーん？　どうしようかな」=“I should wish for someth... Nnn? I wonder?”
「それよりも他に意識がいっちゃうよね」=“You just can't help but focus on the sight itself, can you?”
「そうかも。むしろ、目の前のものに集中しなきゃ損……みたいな？」=“I think so. If anything, I feel like if I don't focus, I'll lose out... I guess?”
「そうそう。だいいち、俺の願いはもう叶ってるし」=“Yeah, that. And honestly, my wish already came true anyway.”
「……そか。そう言われちゃったら、アタシのお願いも叶ったようなものかも」=“...I see. I think mine's more or less there too, now that you say it.”
「多分、同じ願いかな？」=“It's probably the same wish, no?”
「嬉しいけど……それで終わらせちゃうとつまんないかなぁ。なんか探そうよ？　この星のシャワーがやむまでの間に」=“That makes me really happy but... It's a bit boring to end things like that~. Let's search for one, c'mon. Until the star shower stops.”
「二人の願いを？　いいね、世界平和とかかな」=“What, a wish for us to make together? Sounds good, what about world peace or whatever.”
「それでもいいけどもっと二人のことにしようよ。どうせ、二人で願うんだから」=“That's okay too but let's wish for something more about us. I mean, we're the ones wishing for it.”
「そう言われると悩むなぁ」=“Those restrictions make it pretty hard though~”
「いくら時間かけても平気だって。空、まだまだこんなに明るいんだし」=“We can take our time with it. I mean, it's still so bright out.”
