「アタシ、マジでいっぱい頼み過ぎちゃったかも～」=“I think I seriously ordered a bit too much~”
「別に、気にせず食べればいいんじゃない」=“Don't worry about it, just eat as much as you want.”
「そうは言ってもねぇ、食べすぎちゃうのも気になるし～」=“I mean, even if you say that~, I might end up overeating, you know~”

「でもぉ、どれも美味しそうだから仕方ないよね！」=“But~, it all looks so good, so there's not really helping it, is there~!”
「結局一人で食べるつもりなんだ……」=“You really are going to eat it all by yourself, huh...”
