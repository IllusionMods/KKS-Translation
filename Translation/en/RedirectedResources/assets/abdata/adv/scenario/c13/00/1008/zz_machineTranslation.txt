「わぁぁ……すごっ……！」=“Wow ......, that's amazing ......!”
「……流れ星」=“...... shooting stars.”
「うん！　そう、そうなんだけど」=“Yeah!　Yeah, that's right.”
「ここまでだと、流れ星とかそういうのじゃなくない？　シャワーじゃん」=“It's not a shooting star or anything like that up here.　It's just a shower.”
「ずーっと流れてる」=“It goes on and on and on.”
「だね……」=“Yeah. ......”
「あは、見惚れちゃうね」=“Oh, I'm in love with you.”
「[H名]の目にも星が映ってるよ。本当にすごいな……流れ星で空が明るいのなんて初めてだ」=“I see the stars in [H名]'s eyes too. It's really amazing... I've never seen the sky so bright with shooting stars.”
「写真撮ろうかな……ううん、そんなの味気ないか。後で見てもかえって『こんなだったっけ』とか思っちゃいそう」=“I'll take a picture of you. ...... No, that would be tasteless. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.”
「二人で覚えとけばいいよね？」=“We'll just have to remember that, okay?”
「うん、ずっと覚えてよう」=“Yeah, I'll always remember that.”
「だね……あ！　そうだ、お願いしないと」=“Yeah, ......!　Yes, I have to ask.”
「[P名]くんは？　とっくに流れ星に何かお願いした後だったりするのかな」=“What about you, [P名]?　I wonder if they have already asked the shooting star to do something for them.”
「……んー？」=“......?”
「なんでも願い放題だよ。流れ星、まだ全然止まりそうにないし」=“I can wish for anything I want. The shooting stars don't seem to be stopping at all.”
「アタシも何か……うーん？　どうしようかな」=“I want to do something too. ...... Hmm?　I don't know.”
「それよりも他に意識がいっちゃうよね」=“My mind is on other things than that.”
「そうかも。むしろ、目の前のものに集中しなきゃ損……みたいな？」=“Maybe so. Like, if you don't focus on what's in front of you, you'll lose ......?”
「そうそう。だいいち、俺の願いはもう叶ってるし」=“Yeah, yeah. After all, my wish has already come true.”
「……そか。そう言われちゃったら、アタシのお願いも叶ったようなものかも」=“...... I see. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.”
「多分、同じ願いかな？」=“Maybe it's the same wish?”
「嬉しいけど……それで終わらせちゃうとつまんないかなぁ。なんか探そうよ？　この星のシャワーがやむまでの間に」=“I'm glad, but ...... ending it like that would be boring. Let's find something.　Let's find something while the showers on this planet last.”
「二人の願いを？　いいね、世界平和とかかな」=“What do you guys wish for?　Great, world peace, maybe.”
「それでもいいけどもっと二人のことにしようよ。どうせ、二人で願うんだから」=“─ That's fine, but let's make it more about the two of us. We're both going to wish for it anyway.”
「そう言われると悩むなぁ」=“That's what I'm wondering.”
「いくら時間かけても平気だって。空、まだまだこんなに明るいんだし」=“I don't care how long it takes. The sky is still so bright.”
