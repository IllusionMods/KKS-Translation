「メニューが豊富だから、色々選べて飽きないね」=“There's so much to choose from, you'll never get bored.”
「アタシ、マジでいっぱい頼み過ぎちゃったかも～」=“I think I ordered too much food.”
「別に、気にせず食べればいいんじゃない」=“No, you don't have to worry about it. You can just eat it.”
「そうは言ってもねぇ、食べすぎちゃうのも気になるし～」=“That said, I'm also worried about eating too much.”
（まぁ、女の子的には気になる部分か）=(Well, that's the part that concerns girls.)
「でもぉ、どれも美味しそうだから仕方ないよね！」=“But they all look so good, I can't help it!”
「結局一人で食べるつもりなんだ……」=“I'm going to eat alone after all. ......”
