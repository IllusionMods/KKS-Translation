「[H名]の好きそうなものが置いてそうだね。見てみようよ」=“I think I've got something here that [H名] would like. Let's take a look.”
「おお、ガオーッて感じ。乙女心をくすぐってくるじゃん」=“It's like, "Oh, gosh. You're tickling my fancy.”
「ガオーッて感じが乙女に刺さるの？」=“Does the "whoosh" sound appeal to girls?”
「乙女心っていうか厳密にはアタシ心？　へへへ、可愛い～」=“I'm not sure if it's a girl's heart or if it's strictly a girl's heart.　Hehehe, cute.”
「そんなにかなぁ……」=“I'm not so sure. ......”
「いいじゃん。大事なのはアタシが気に入るかどうかでしょ？　アタシが好きなら他人になんて言われても関係ないし」=“That's fine. The important thing is whether you like it or not, right?　If I like it, it doesn't matter what other people say.”
「なんでこっち見て言うの？　別の話になってきてない？」=“Why are you looking at me like that?　Are we talking about something else?”
「あはは、冗談だよ、冗談」=“Ha-ha-ha. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.”
「ホントに違うからね？　[P名]くんは評判いいし、アタシにとっても自慢の彼氏だから」=“It's really not the same, okay?　[P名] has a great reputation and I'm very proud of him.”
「……最初はそんな話じゃなかったような？　ま、まあ、嬉しいけど」=“...... Didn't we talk about this at first?　Well, I'm glad you're here.”
「むむ♪　ってことで、このキーホルダー買っちゃお？」=“Mmm. So, should I buy this keychain?”
「うん、気に入ったならいいんじゃないかな」=“Yeah, I think you'll like it.”
「買っちゃお？　って言ってんじゃん。一緒に買っておそろにするの」=“I said, "Should we buy it?　I said, "Why don't you buy it? We'll buy them together and wear them together.”
「俺もそれつけるのか。そっかー……」=“I'm gonna wear that. I see. ......”
