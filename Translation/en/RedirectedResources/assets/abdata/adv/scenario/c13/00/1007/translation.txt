「へえ、珍しい魚がいっぱいいるねー」=“Heh, there's a whole lot of unique fish here, aren't there~?”
「たとえばどれとか？」=“Like which ones?”
「名前はわかんないけど。カラフルな、いかにも南国っぽいのとか」=“I don't really know any of the names but, the colorful and, really tropical looking ones.”
「……どれだろ？」=“...Which ones?”
（可愛い……）=(So cute...)
「ん？　今、アタシの横顔見てなかった。不意打ちとはデリカシーないなぁ」=“Nn? Didn't you just steal a glance at my face there? That's not very nice of you, to do it while I wasn't looking~”
「そういうつもりじゃなくてっ」=“That's not what I was trying at--”
「えー、見てたよ。人のこと水槽に気を逸らしておいて……何？　イタズラでもしようとしたの？」=“Eh~, I was watching you. You distracted me by making me look at the tank and stuff... What, were you trying to play a little prank on me or something?”
「なんでちょっと嬉しそうなの？　本当に違くて」=“Why do you look happy about that? It really isn't that.”
「…………うん？」=“...Then?”
「可愛いなぁって……そ、それだけだから」=“I was just thinking... t-that you looked adorable.”
「ふーん？　つまり水族館のムーディな雰囲気と可愛いアタシにドキドキしちゃったんだ」=“Hmm~? So basically, the mood of the aquarium and my cuteness got to you and made your heart pound, huh?”
「そんなとこ！　さ、さて、他に珍しい海の生き物はいるかな」=“More or less! N-Now then, wonder if there's any other unique sea life in here.”
「どうだろねー？」=“Who knows~?”
（ニヤニヤしてる……）=(She's grinning ear to ear...)
「……ねえ、チューしよっか？」=“...Hey, wanna kiss?”
「脈絡がない！」=“How'd you get from that to that!?”
「あるもんね。むしろ、そっちがその気にさせたじゃ～ん」=“I just did. If anything, you made me do it~”
「謝るからここでは水槽に集中させてください」=“I'll apologize so please do let me focus on the tanks, miss.”
