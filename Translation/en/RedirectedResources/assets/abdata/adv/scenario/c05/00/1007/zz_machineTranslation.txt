「いろいろな種類の魚が泳いでるね」=There are all kinds of fish swimming around.
「あっ！　見て見て、大きなクラゲが泳いでる」=Oh!　Look, look, there's a big jellyfish swimming.
「ゆっくりと上下に揺れながら挨拶してる。わぁ、かわいい♪」=I'm bobbing up and down slowly as I say hello. It's so cute.
（上機嫌だ。海の生物を気に入ったみたいだな）=(He's in a good mood. I think he likes sea life.
「クラゲって不思議だよね。泳ぐ姿を眺めてるだけで癒やされちゃう」=Jellyfish are strange, aren't they? Just watching them swim is soothing.
「まるで宇宙を泳いでるみたいだよね」=It's like we're swimming in space.
「うんうん。そうなんだよ～。さすがわかってるね」=Yeah, yeah. That's right. You know what you're talking about.
「いいなぁ。わたしもクラゲになりたい。それで宇宙を自由に泳ぎ回るの」=I want to be a jellyfish. I want to become a jellyfish too. I want to be a jellyfish so I can swim freely in space.
「クラゲになれば、“かれら”とも交信しやすくなるからね」=It's easier to communicate with them when you're a jellyfish.
「手が複数あれば、ボディランゲージで意思疎通できるから？」=Because if you have more than one hand, you can communicate through body language?
「ううん、違うよ。クラゲは電波で交信してるの。だから、人よりクラゲの方が“かれら”と繋がりやすくなるんだよ」=No, you're wrong. Jellyfish communicate with each other via radio waves. That's why it's easier for jellyfish to connect with them than it is for people.
「ええっ！？　それって本当の話？」=What?　Is that true?
「そうだ！　今からテレパシーの練習をしよっか。わたしが何を考えてるか当ててみて？」=Yes!　Let's practice telepathy now. Can you guess what I'm thinking?
「急にそんなことを言われても……」=I'm sorry to tell you this on such short notice.
「ほら、いいから早く早く」=Come on, come on, come on.
「えっと……俺のことが好き、とか？」=Uh, ...... like me?
「わぁ、すごい！　大正解っ♪」=Oh, my God!　You're right.
「やっぱり[P名]くんは、わたしが見込んだ通りの人だよ。いつか一緒にクラゲになろうね♪」=I knew [P名] would be just as I expected him to be. Let's become jellyfish together someday.
「クラゲかぁ。できれば別の生き物でお願いします……」=I'm not sure what to say. Jellyfish. If possible, please use another creature. ......
