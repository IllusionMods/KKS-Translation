「うーん……やっぱり楽器を弾くのは難しいね」=“Nnnn... it really is difficult to learn an instrument, isn't it?”
「うん……でも、頑張って覚えないと」=“Yeah... but, I have to do my best and learn it.”
「何か理由があるの？　音色が好きとか？」=“Any reason for that? Do you like the sound of it?”
「昔、宇宙に打ち上げられた探査機には、地球の音がたくさん入ったレコードが積まれてたの」=“Back in the day, when we used to send probes out into space, they were loaded up with records of human culture, including music.”
「私もそれに倣って、“かれら”に同じ様なレコードを届けようと思ってるんだ」=“I want to imitate that, and send music to "them" too, just like that.”
（自分で弾かずに音源を探してくればいいような……？　まあ、張り切ってるみたいだし、いいか）=(Wouldn't it be better to just send a music player then...? Well, she seems really into it, so why not?)
