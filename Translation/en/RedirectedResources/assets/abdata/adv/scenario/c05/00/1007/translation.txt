「いろいろな種類の魚が泳いでるね」=“There's all sorts of fish swimming in here, aren't there?”
「あっ！　見て見て、大きなクラゲが泳いでる」=“Ah--! Look look, what a big jellyfish!”
「ゆっくりと上下に揺れながら挨拶してる。わぁ、かわいい♪」=“It's swishing up and down, like it's saying hi to us. Wah~, so cute♪”
（上機嫌だ。海の生物を気に入ったみたいだな）=(She's in a great mood. Must really like the fish, huh?)
「クラゲって不思議だよね。泳ぐ姿を眺めてるだけで癒やされちゃう」=“Jellyfish are really something, aren't they? Just looking at them floating around is so soothing.”
「まるで宇宙を泳いでるみたいだよね」=“Almost feels like they're floating around in space, doesn't it?”
「うんうん。そうなんだよ～。さすがわかってるね」=“Yepyep. Exactly~. You really do get it.”
「いいなぁ。わたしもクラゲになりたい。それで宇宙を自由に泳ぎ回るの」=“Must be nice~. I wanna become a jellyfish too. I'd be able to swim around in space all I want then.”
「クラゲになれば、“かれら”とも交信しやすくなるからね」=“And especially since the communication between me and "them" would get a whole lot smoother too.”
「手が複数あれば、ボディランゲージで意思疎通できるから？」=“Because of all the hands? Guess you'd be able to communicate with body language better?”
「ううん、違うよ。クラゲは電波で交信してるの。だから、人よりクラゲの方が“かれら”と繋がりやすくなるんだよ」=“Nope, that's not it. Jellyfish actually communicate via electric signals. That's why, if I was a jellyfish, I'd have a much easier time communicating with "them".”
「ええっ！？　それって本当の話？」=“Eeh--?! Is that actually true?”
「そうだ！　今からテレパシーの練習をしよっか。わたしが何を考えてるか当ててみて？」=“This is a good chance! Let's practice telepathy right now. Try guessing what I'm thinking right now?”
「急にそんなことを言われても……」=“I mean, there's no way I could...”
「ほら、いいから早く早く」=“C'mon, just try it once. Trust me.”
「えっと……俺のことが好き、とか？」=“Erhm... you're thinking about how much you love me, I guess?”
「わぁ、すごい！　大正解っ♪」=“Wah~, amazing! You're bang on--♪”
「やっぱり[P名]くんは、わたしが見込んだ通りの人だよ。いつか一緒にクラゲになろうね♪」=“You really are, just the sort of person I thought you were, [P名]-kun. Let's become jellyfish together someday, okay?~♪”
「クラゲかぁ。できれば別の生き物でお願いします……」=“A jellyfish, huh? If possible, I'd rather be any other lifeform...”
