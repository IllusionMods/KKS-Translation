「卓球で一勝負していかない？」=Why don't we play a game of ping-pong?
「えへへ、負けないよぉ～」=Heh, I can't lose!
「やるからには全力でいくよ。いざ勝負！」=I'm going to give it my all. Let's do it!
「やったぁ。勝った～っ！」=Yay! I won!
「ぜぇぜぇ……ま、負けた……。まさか１点も取れないなんて」=I can't believe we ...... lost. I can't believe we didn't get a single point.
「俺が打つ球、どうしてすべて打ち返せたの？」=How did you manage to hit all the balls I hit back?
「[P名]くんの目を見ていたらなんとなくね」=When I looked into your eyes, I felt something.
「あとは“かれら”の助言かな？」=And what about their advice?
「助言？」=Advice?
「うん！　“かれら”の声に従ってラケットを振ったら、ぜんぶの球を打ち返せたんだよ」="Yes!　"I followed their voice and swung my racket, and I was able to hit all the balls back.
「くそ～！　１対１じゃなかったわけか」=Damn it!　So it wasn't one on one.
「えへへ、ごめんね。今度は“かれら”の助言なしで勝負しよっ」=Heh, I'm sorry. Let's play without their advice this time.
「よ～し。次こそ負けないぞ～」=Okay. Next time I won't lose.
「ふふっ。お手柔らかにね」=Hmm. Go easy on me.
