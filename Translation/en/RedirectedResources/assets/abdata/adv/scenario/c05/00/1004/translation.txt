「少し浜辺を歩こうよ」=“Let's walk along the beach a bit.”
「いい風が吹いてるね……」=“The breeze feels so nice...”
「海っていいよね。どこまでも果てしなく広がってて……」=“The sea's just awesome, isn't it? It stretches out forever, as far as the eye can see...”
「まるで宇宙みたいだよね」=“It's almost like space, isn't it?”
「うんうん！　そうなの。よくわかってるね」=“Yeah, yeah! Exactly. You really do get it.”
「ねえ、知ってる？　宇宙だけじゃなくて、深いところにも“かれら”は棲んでるんだよ」=“Hey, did you know? It's not just space, "they" live within the deep depths too?”
「え？　海底に潜んでるってこと？」=“Eh? You mean at the bottom of the seas and oceans?”
「そうだよ。海の底にある大きな神殿で深い眠りについてるの」=“That's right. "They" are slumbering within sanctuaries deep at the bottom of the Earth's oceans.”
「こうして波の音に耳を傾けると、深淵から聞こえてくるんだ。“かれら”の呼び声が」=“When I stress my ears and listen to the sound of the waves, I can hear it from the abyss. "Their" call.”
「うっ……それは怖いかも……」=“Uu--... that sounds pretty scary, I'mma be honest...”
「大丈夫。心を落ち着かせて、ありのままに受け入れれば平気だよ」=“Don't worry. You'll be fine as long as you calm your heart, and just take it in as it is.”
「怖いなら、わたしがついてるから。いつか一緒に挨拶しに行こうね」=“If you're scared, remember that I'm here. Let's go say hi to them together someday, okay?”
「わたしが[P名]くんを好きになったように、“かれら”もあなたのことを気に入ると思うから」=“I'm sure they'll take a liking to you too, just like how I fell in love with you.”
「わかった。そのときはきちんと言うよ。[H名]を大事にしますってね」=“Got it. And I'll tell them at that time too. That I'll treasure you properly, and won't let anything happen to you.”
「えへへ。照れちゃうなぁ～」=“Eheheh. You're gonna make me blush~”
「でも今は、[H名]との生活を満喫したいかな」=“But for now, I think I want to just enjoy our life together, [H名].”
「うん。わたしも、もうしばらく[P名]くんと地上にいたい」=“Yep. Me too, for now I want to live on the surface with you, [P名]-kun.”
「『ここ』でしかできないこと……たくさん経験したいな」=“I wanna experience a whole lot of things... that we can only experience "here" and "now".”
