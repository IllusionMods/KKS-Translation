「変わった味付けですが、こちらのお食事も美味しいですわね」=“The seasoning is quite unique, though the food here is very delicious in general, isn't it?”
「うんうん、美味しいよね。俺、おかわりしようかな」=“Yepyep, it is. I think I might go for seconds.”
「まあ、そんなにお腹に入りますの？　殿方の身体は不思議ですわ」=“My, you can really fit all that in there? Men's bodies truly are mysteries.”
「不思議って程でもないと思うけど。お父さんだって、よく食べてるんじゃない？」=“I don't think it's anything that insane. Your father probably eats a whole lot too, no?”
「お父様がばくばくと頬張っている姿は……全く想像がつきませんわね」=“The sight of my father stuffing his mouth... is one I cannot imagine at all.”
（あー……普段から綺麗な所作でフレンチ料理とか食べてそうだしなぁ）=(Ah... she does seem like the type to eat French food with pretty table manners on the regular, doesn't she?)
