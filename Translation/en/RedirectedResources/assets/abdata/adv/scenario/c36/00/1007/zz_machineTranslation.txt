「[H名]さん、深海魚の水槽があるみたいだよ」=“[H名], it looks like they have a deep-sea fish tank.”
「[H名]さん？　そんなに囓りついてなにを見てるの？」=“[H名]?　What are you looking at that you're so gnawing on?”
「別に……なかなか興味深いと思っていただけよ」=“I just thought it was ...... pretty interesting.”
「小魚の群れが？　えっと、この魚の種類は……」=“A school of small fish?　Well, what kind of fish is this ......?”
「種類はなんだって良いわ」=“I don't care what kind.”
「えっ？　でも、興味を持っているんじゃないの？」=“What?　But you're interested in it, aren't you?”
「ええ。こう……簡単にぐちゃっと潰せそうなのが良いわよね」=“Yes. It's good that it's so ...... easy to mess up.”
「[H名]さん、怖いよ！？」=“[H名], you're scaring me!”
「フフッ、冗談よ。でも、ここまで群れられると、それなりに見応えがあるわね」=“I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. But it's quite a sight to see them all crowded together like this.”
「貴方はどう思う？　私のように、踏み潰したくなるのかしら？」=“What do you think?　Does it make you want to stomp them out like it does me?”
「いや……特にそういう感想はないかな。普通に可愛いとか、綺麗とか、この魚知ってるーとか……」=“No, ...... I don't have any particular thoughts on that. No, I don't think that's what I meant. I just thought it was cute, beautiful, and I know this fish. ......”
「今は、[H名]さんと一緒に水族館デートできてるのが楽しいかな」=“Right now, I'm enjoying having an aquarium date with [H名].”
「……そう。まぁ、貴方が楽しめているならそれでいいんじゃない」=“...... Yes. Well, if you're enjoying it, that's fine.”
「それで、向こうに深海魚の水槽があるんだったかしら？」=“So, they have a deep-sea fish tank over there, right?”
「うん。良かったら一緒に見に行きたいなって思ったんだけど……」=“Yeah. I was wondering if you'd like to go with me to see it. ......”
「そうね、深海魚は深海魚で滑稽よね。地上まで引きずり上げられて、見世物になっているんだもの」=“Well, deep-sea fish are funny deep-sea fish, aren't they? They're dragged up to the surface and made a spectacle of.”
「は、はは……楽しみ方は人それぞれだけど……。[H名]さんは変わってるね……」=“Haha, haha, ... everyone has their own way of having fun... [H名], you are different...”
