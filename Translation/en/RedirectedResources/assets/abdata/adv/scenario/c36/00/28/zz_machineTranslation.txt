「……この部屋、少しにおうわね」=“...... This room smells a little.”
「旅先だというのに、貴方は虚しく自分を慰めていたの？　気持ちが悪い」=“You're on a trip and you're vainly consoling yourself?　That's disgusting.”
「私が相手してあげるから、そんなことはもう止めなさい。次にこの部屋を借りる人が可哀想だわ」=“I'll take care of you, but don't do that again. The next person who rents this room is going to be so sad.”
