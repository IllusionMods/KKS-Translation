「貴方、こんな特技があったのね。普通に気持ちが良かったわ」=“I didn't know you had any of these skills. It's just a nice feeling.”
「まだまだね。私はこれくらいじゃ満足しないから、次はもっとしっかりやりなさい」=“No, not yet. I'm not satisfied with this. You'll have to do better next time.”
「低いハードルすら下回る結果だったわ。もう少し腕を磨いておきなさい」=“You've fallen short of even the lowest hurdle. You need to work on your skills.”
「なに？　恐れ多くて私に触れられないとでも言うの？」=“What?　You're too afraid to touch me?”
