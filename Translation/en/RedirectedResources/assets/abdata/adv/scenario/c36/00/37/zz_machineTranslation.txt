「あの……[H名]さん？　一緒に遊ぶはずなんじゃ……なんで俺は砂に埋められてるの？」=“The ... [H名]?　We're supposed to be playing together... Why am I buried in the sand?”
「は？　貴方と一緒に遊ぶなんて、一言も言っていないわ。私は貴方で遊んであげると言ったのよ」=“What?　I never said anything about playing with you. I said I would play with you.”
「そっか……俺は普通にスイカ割りとかして、[H名]さんと遊びたかったよ」=“I see... I wanted to play with [H名] like a normal person, splitting watermelons and stuff.”
「へぇ、口答えするのね。それじゃあ、このまま放置しようかしら」=“Oh, you talk back. Well, I guess I'll just leave it there.”
「こんなガチガチに固めた状態で！？　ごめんなさい、幾らでも遊んでいいから放置するのだけは止めてくださいっ！」=“In such a hardened state?　I'm sorry, you can play with it as much as you want, just don't leave it!”
