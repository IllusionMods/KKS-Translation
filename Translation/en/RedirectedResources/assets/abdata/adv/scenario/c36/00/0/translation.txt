「喜びなさい、貴方の名前、憶えてあげたわ」=“Rejoice, I memorised your name.”
「えっ、それって……呼んでくれるって事？」=“Umm, does that mean... You'll call me...”
「いいえ、ただの家畜から、名前のある豚になっただけよ。それだけでも十分なご褒美でしょう？」=“Nope. You're a livestock, so you just became a pig with a name. That alone is enough of a reward for you, isn't it?”
「う、うん！　そうだね！　一歩前進って事だもんね！」=“Y-yes! This is it! That's one step forward!”
「どう取るかは貴方次第よ。ただ、私を失望させるような真似はしないことね」=“How you interpret it is up to you. But don't disappoint me, understood?”
「わかってる。俺頑張るよ！」=“Understood. I'll do my best!”
「フフッ、興奮し過ぎよ。少しは恥じらいというものを持ちなさい、人間扱いして欲しいならね」=“Fufu, don't get too excited. Have some restraint, if you want to be treated as a human that is.”
「あはは……でも、喜べって言ったのは[H名]さんだよ？」=“Ahaha... But the one who said to rejoice was Miss [H名], right?”
「ふぅん、言うようになったじゃない。少し前までただの家畜だったのに、生意気ね」=“Huuh, you've learned how to speak didn't you. Even though you were just livestock until a while ago.”
