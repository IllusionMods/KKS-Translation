「あの……エッチがしたいんだけど、いい？」=“I'd like to ...... have sex with you, if that's okay.”
「いいけど……もうちょっとムードのある言い方ってあるんじゃないかな？」=“It's okay, but ...... there's a way to say it that's a little more moody, don't you think?”
「うっ……ごめん。ひねりが無さ過ぎたね」=“Ugh ...... sorry. I'm sorry, that was too twisted.”
「うん、ストレートすぎるよ。でも、そういう所、嫌いじゃないよ♪」=“Yeah, that's too straightforward. But I don't mind that about you.”
