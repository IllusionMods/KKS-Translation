「ねね、キミと私がもっと仲良くなれる方法を思いついたんだけど、聞きたい？」=“Hey, I've got an idea for how you and I can get to know each other better. You want to hear it?”
「エッチなこと？」=“Sex?”
「も～、何でもそっちに結び付けるの禁止！　愛称、二人で呼び合うの」=“You're my grandpa now." "Moo~, you can't link everything to that!　We call each other by our nicknames.”
「あ、いいね！」=“Oh, yeah!”
「私はもう考えてきたんだ～。彼女が愛情たっぷりに呼んであげるね」=“I've already thought of that! I've already thought about it. - She'll call you lovingly.”
「おお……なんかいいね。あとすごく照れる」=“Oh, ......, that's nice. It's also very embarrassing.”
「ホント？　私のことも愛称で呼んでみて！」=“Really?　You can call me by my nickname, too.”
「あぅ……たしかに呼ばれるのもけっこう恥ずかしいね」=“Oh ......, it's quite embarrassing to be called that, isn't it?”
「だけど、もっと仲良くなれた気がするね」=“But I feel like we're getting to know each other better.”
「あ、うん……えへへ♪　キミさえよければ、また呼んでみてもいい？」=“Uh, yeah, ....... Can I call you again if you're okay with it?”
「もちろん。たまに呼んだりしたら、ドキッとするかもね」=“Sure. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to hear you call him sometimes.”
