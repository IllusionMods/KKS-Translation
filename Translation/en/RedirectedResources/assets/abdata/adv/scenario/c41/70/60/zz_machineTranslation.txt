「こんばんはー。ボクだけど、いる？　連絡もしないで来ちゃってごめんね。急に会いたくなっちゃって……」=“Good evening. It's me. Are you there?　I'm sorry I came without calling you. I just had a sudden urge to see you. ......”
「[H名]？　もう夜だけど、どうしたの？」=“[H名]?　It's night already, what's wrong?”
「あ……うん、そう、夜だけど……というより、夜だから、かな？　キミのことを考えてたら、どうしても会いたくなっちゃって……」=“I'm not sure if it's because it's ...... night, but rather because it's ...... night.　I was thinking about you and I just had to see you. ......”
「もう遅いし、我慢してベッドに入ったんだけど、どんどん身体が火照ってきちゃって……ひとりでするぐらいなら、キミとしたいなって……」=“It was late, and I went to bed patiently, but my body was getting hotter and hotter. ...... I'd rather do it with you than by myself. ......”
「そんな風に言われたら、俺も我慢できなくなるよ。しっかり鍵をかけて、ふたりが満足するまでヤりまくっちゃおう」=“I can't stand it when you talk to me like that. Let's lock the door tight and fuck until we're both satisfied.”
「……あっ、もう寝てるのかな……？　起こすのも悪いし、帰ろうっと……おやすみ、バイバイ……」=“I'm not sure if he's already sleeping ......?　I don't want to wake you up, let's go home. ......Good night, bye-bye. ......”
