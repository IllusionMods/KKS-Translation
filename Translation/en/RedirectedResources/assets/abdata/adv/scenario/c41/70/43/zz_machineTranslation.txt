「この島に来てから、たまにどこかから三線の音色が聞こえてきてたけど、自分で弾くとなるとやっぱり難しいね」=“Since I've been here, I've heard the sound of the sanshin (Okinawan guitar) from somewhere, but it's hard to play by myself.”
「うん。でもやるからにはマスターしたいよね。先生が『三線を弾きながら告白した人が今の旦那さん』って話してて、ときめいちゃったし」=“I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it. But if I'm going to do it, I want to master it. My teacher told me that the man she confessed her love to while playing the sanshin was her current husband, and I fell in love with him.”
「たしかにロマンチックな話だったね。しかしなるほど、[H名]は告白したい派か」=“It was a romantic story, wasn't it? But I see... [H名] wants to confess her feelings.”
「えっ……べ、別にしたい派ってわけじゃ……その、好きな人なら、されるのも大歓迎だよ……って、ボク何言っちゃってるんだろうね、あはは」=“I'm not saying that I want to ...... do it, but if you like it, you're welcome to do it. ...... What am I saying? I don't know. Ha-ha-ha.”
「いや、そこの所もっと詳しく」=“No, I need you to be more specific.”
「な、なんで拘るの？　詳しくって言われても……その……あっ、そろそろ休憩時間終わるから、練習に戻ろうっ！」=“Why are you so obsessed with it?　If you want me to elaborate on that...... that...... oh, break time is almost over, so let's get back to practice!”
（逃げたな……）=(You got away with it. ......)
