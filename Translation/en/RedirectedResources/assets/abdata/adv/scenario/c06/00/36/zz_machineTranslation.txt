「やっぱり南の島に来たら海で遊ばないと」=“When you come to the South Island, you have to go to the beach.”
「さっそく泳ぐに行く？　あ、でも泳ぎが苦手なら言ってね」=“You want to go for a swim?　Well, if you're not a good swimmer, let me know.”
「不得手ではございませんが、思いっきり身体を動かす事より、ゆっくりしたい気分ではございます」=“It's not that I'm not good at it, but I'd rather relax than do anything strenuous.”
「分かった。それじゃあ浜辺で砂の城でも作りながらのんびりしようか」=“Okay. So, why don't we relax on the beach, make sandcastles?”
「普段、海では遊んだりするの？」=“Do you usually go to the beach?”
「いえ、あまり……幼い頃に祖母と遊んだ記憶が微かにあるくらいでしょうか」=“No, not really. ...... I have a faint memory of playing with my grandmother when I was little.”
「久しぶりの海なんだ。それじゃあいっぱい楽しまないとね」=“It's been a long time since I've been to the beach. It's been a long time since I've been to the beach, so I should have a lot of fun.”
