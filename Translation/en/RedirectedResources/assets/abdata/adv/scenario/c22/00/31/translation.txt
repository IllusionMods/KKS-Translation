「うん、こんなにいっぱいあると、どれにしようか迷っちゃうね」=“Yeah, when there's this many, it's a bit hard to pick one thing out, isn't it?”
「何か買っていくの？」=“You gonna buy something?”
「どうしようかなー。お土産は欲しいけど、荷物になっちゃうんだよねー」=“Maybe, I dunno~. I do want some souvenirs but, we're just gonna have to carry them back, won't we~”

「とりあえず、今日は見るだけにしようかな」=“Maybe I'll just look around for today.”
