「さすがに観光地のお店だけあって、お土産物がいっぱいだね」=“As expected of a restaurant in a tourist spot, it's full of souvenirs.”
「うん、こんなにいっぱいあると、どれにしようか迷っちゃうね」=“Yeah, it's hard to decide which one to choose when there are so many.”
「何か買っていくの？」=“Are you going to buy something?”
「どうしようかなー。お土産は欲しいけど、荷物になっちゃうんだよねー」=“I don't know. I'd like a souvenir, but I'd have to pack one.”
「確かに……買いすぎると大変だよね」=“It's hard to buy too much .......”
「とりあえず、今日は見るだけにしようかな」=“I think I'll just watch for now.”
