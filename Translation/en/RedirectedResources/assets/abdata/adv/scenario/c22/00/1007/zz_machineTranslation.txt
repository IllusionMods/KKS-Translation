「わぁぁ……この水槽大きいね。お魚もたくさんいるし……あっ、見てみて、カメさんもいるよ！」=“Wow. ...... This tank is huge. There are a lot of fish in it. ...... Oh, look, there's a turtle!”
「どこどこ？　あ、本当だ。優雅に泳いでるね」=“Where?　Oh, it's true. They swim so gracefully.”
「うん、しかも二匹で仲良さそうに！　恋人同士かな？　夫婦かなぁ？　私たちもいつかあんな風になれたらいいなぁ」=“Yeah, and they look so cute together!　Are they lovers?　Are they a couple?　I hope we can be like that someday.”
「……え？　あっ、え、えっとっ、違うのっ！　今のはそのっ……傍にいられたらって意味でっ……べ、別にっ……ふ、夫婦って意味じゃ……」=“...... What?　Oh, no, no, no, no, no!　It's not that I don't want to be with you. ...... It's not that I don't want to be with you. ...... It's not that I don't want to be with you. ...... It's not that I don't want to be with you. ...”
「そうなの？　俺は別にそういう意味でも構わないけど……」=“Oh, yeah?　I don't really care if that's what you mean. ......”
「はぅっ……そ、そんなことあっさり言っちゃだめーっ！　色々考えちゃって、君のこと真っ直ぐ見られなくなるっ！」=“I've been thinking a lot about you.　You'll be thinking too much and won't be able to see you straight!”
「え、えーっと……あっ、ほらっ、お魚、他にもいっぱいいるよ！　わぁ、あの子、大きいー！　ほらほら見てーっ！」=“Uh, let's see. ...... Oh, look, there's lots more fish!　Wow, he's a big one!　Look, look, look!”
「あはは、もう完全に集中できなくなってない？」=“Ha-ha-ha. You've completely lost your concentration, haven't you?”
「もーっ、君が変なこと言うからーっ！　いじわるーっ！」=“I like you more and more because you say weird things.　You're such a tease!”
「ごめんごめん、冗談だよ。[H名]の反応が可愛いからつい……こんな俺だけど……あのカメたちみたいに、ずっと一緒にいてくれる？」=“Sorry, sorry, just kidding. [H名]'s reaction was so cute that I just ended up ... being like this ... like those turtles, will you stay with me forever?”
「あ……うんっ！　当然だよ。君が嫌っていっても、私がそうしちゃうんだから♪」=“...... Yes!　Of course. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your money.”
「でも……そういう気持ちで見たら、つがいで泳いでる子たちって結構いるんだね。ほら、あの子たちもくっついて泳いでる」=“I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it. You can see them swimming together.”
「えーっと……それは俺ともっとくっつきたいってこと？」=“Let's see. ...... Does that mean you want to get more involved with me?”
「そ、そうじゃなくてっ！　あっ、やっ、く、くっつきたいとは思ってるけどっ……はぅぅっ……」=“No, that's not it!　I want to get together with you, but I don't want to .......”
「あはは、ごめん。水槽の前は冷えるから、もっとくっついて見よっか？」=“Haha, sorry. It gets cold in front of the tank, so why don't we stick closer?”
「うんっ♪　お魚さんたちに負けないくらい、ぴったりくっついちゃうよ♪」=“Yes. They'll stick together as well as the fishes.”
