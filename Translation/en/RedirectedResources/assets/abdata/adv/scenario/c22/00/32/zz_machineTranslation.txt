「結構、大きな灯台だねー」=“That's a pretty big lighthouse.”
「そうかな、普通くらいだと思うけど……日本で一番高い灯台は約４３ｍあるらしいよ」=“I don't know, I think it's pretty normal. ...... They say the tallest lighthouse in Japan is about 43 meters high.”
「そうなんだ……だったら、普通くらいなのかな」=“Yeah, I think ...... is pretty normal.”
「まぁ、大きくても小さくても、船に光が届けばいいわけだしね」=“Well, it doesn't matter how big or small the light is, as long as it gets to the ship.”
「そうだね……灯台は目立つのが一番だね、うん」=“Yeah, ...... lighthouse is the best way to stand out, yeah.”
