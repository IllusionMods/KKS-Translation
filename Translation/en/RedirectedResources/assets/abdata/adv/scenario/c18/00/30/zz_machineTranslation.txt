「なんというか、灯台ってどこも似たような感じだね」=“I don't know, lighthouses all look the same.”
「う、うーん……？　私、詳しい訳じゃないので、よくわからないです」=“Uh-huh. ......?　I don't know, I don't know much about it.”
「俺も詳しいって程じゃないけどね。あ、ただ光り方は灯台によって違ってるらしいよ」=“I don't know much about it, either. I don't know much about it, but I've heard that different lighthouses light up in different ways.”
「街の灯りと違いを出さないと、船が航路を間違えたりするらしいからね」=“I'll stay with you as long as it takes. - They say if you don't differentiate yourself from the lights in the city, the ship will take the wrong turn.”
「なるほど、灯台って重要なんですね。……道しるべ、私も見つけたいです」=“I see. Lighthouses are very important, aren't they? I want to find the ...... signposts.”
