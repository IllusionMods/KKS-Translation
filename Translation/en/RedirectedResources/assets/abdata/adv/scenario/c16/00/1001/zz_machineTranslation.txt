「ここ涼しいね。ちょっと休んでいかない？」=“It's cool here. Why don't we take a break?”
「……旅っていいわね。こういう時に、ふと実感するわ」=“...... Travel is great. It's times like this that I really feel it.”
「気分いいなー、ってこと？」=“Are you saying you feel good?”
「要約してしまえばそういうことなのでしょうけど……何て言えばいいのかしら」=“I guess that sums it up. ...... What can I say?”
「暑さを感じたらリモコンを探すような生活が当たり前になると、団扇の風の心地よさを知る機会はないでしょう？」=“When you live your life looking for the remote control when you feel the heat, you won't have the chance to feel the comfort of a fan, will you?”
「何気ない発見、みたいなことかな」=“It's like a casual discovery.”
「そうそう。さっきよりは近づいたわ。……むしろ、言いたいことズバリかも」=“Yeah, yeah. I'm closer than I was before. I'm closer than I've ever been. ...... I think you've got the point.”
「……大げさではなく、私にとってここは新しい世界」=“...... I'm not exaggerating, this is a new world for me.”
「たくさんの自然が残っていて、少し違う文化があって……たくさんの未知が何気なくあちらこちらに佇んでいる」=“So much nature, so many different cultures, so many ...... unknowns casually lingering here and there.”
「うん、新鮮な体験は多いかな」=“Yeah, it's a new experience for a lot of people.”
「そうでしょう？　そこまで大きな期待はしていなかったのだけど、思いがけず見識が……」=“Isn't that right?　I didn't have such high expectations, but I got an unexpected insight from .......”
「なんて……私みたいな小娘がこんな言い方をしたら、生意気もいいところよね」=“What a ...... little girl like me would be cheeky to talk like this.”
「生意気なんてことはないよ。そういうのだって立派な旅の楽しみ方だよ」=“Don't be cocky. There's nothing cheeky about it, it's a great way to travel.”
「語りすぎ、って思ってない？　今更すぎるかしら」=“Are you sure you want to talk about this?　It's too late for that.”
「[H名]の言うことはユニークだし聞いてて面白いよ。これからも遠慮なく語ってほしいな」=“[H名] is unique and interesting to listen to. I hope you will not hesitate to talk about it in the future.”
「そう言ってくれると救われるわ。アナタとの時間は心地よくて……それでつい、饒舌になってしまうのかも」=“It's a relief to hear you say that. It's a relief to hear you say that, because it makes me feel more comfortable with you. ...... Maybe that's why I'm so talkative.”
「さすがに野暮だったわね。せっかくのこの時間、贅沢に浸りましょ」=“That was really uncalled for. Let's soak up the luxury of this time.”
「うん、そうだね……」=“Yeah, I guess so. ......”
「ふぅ、いい風……」=“Phew, nice breeze. ......”
