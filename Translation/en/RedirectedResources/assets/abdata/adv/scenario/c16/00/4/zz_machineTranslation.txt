「呆れるわ……男って本当に、本能の赴くままに動いてるのね」=“It's disgusting. ...... Men really do follow their instincts, don't they?”
「呆れられたっていいよ……俺は本気で、キミとしたいんだ」=“I don't care if you're stunned. ...... I really, really want to do this with you.”
「……そんなに私がいいの？」=“...... Do you like me that much?”
「キミがいい……いや、キミじゃないとダメなんだ」=“I want you. ...... No, it has to be you.”
「そこまで言うなら、仕方がないわね。その代わり、優しないと怒るから」=“If you insist, then I have no choice. I'll get angry if you're not nice to me.”
