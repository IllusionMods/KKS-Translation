「遅い時間にごめんなさい。今、大丈夫かしら？」=“I'm sorry it's so late. Is this a good time?”
「問題ないけど、どうかしたの？」=“No problem. What's wrong?”
「えっと、大事な用事があるのよ……アナタと、私にしかできない事なんだけど……」=“Well, I have something important to do, and it's something that only you and I can do. ......”
「もう、最後まで言わせないで……分かって、くれるわよね？」=“Don't make me finish. ...... You understand, don't you?”
「留守なのね……仕方がないわ、またにしましょう」=“You're not home, are you? ...... I can't help it, we'll have to do this again.”
