「どれもこれも、全部美味しいね」=“It's all very good, all of it.”
「本当ね。ネットの評価も高いんじゃないかしら」=“It's true. I bet it's getting good reviews on the Internet.”
「ネットにはあんまり載ってないみたい。お客さんは地元の人が多いんじゃないかな」=“It doesn't seem to be on the Internet much. I think most of the customers are locals.”
「なるほど。そういうお店が、本当の名店なのかもしれないわね」=“I see. Maybe that's the kind of restaurant that's really great.”
