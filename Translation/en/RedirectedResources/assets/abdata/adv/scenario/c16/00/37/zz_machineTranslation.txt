「海が綺麗だと、ただ散歩するだけでも気分がいいね」=“When the sea is beautiful, it's nice to just take a walk.”
「ここの砂、一体何でできてるのかしら？　多分サンゴか貝殻だと思うのだけど……」=“I wonder what the sand is made of?　I think it's coral or seashells. ......”
「潮風も気持ちいいし、波も穏やかだよ」=“The sea breeze is nice and the waves are calm.”
「所々砂に穴が開いてるわね。何か生物の巣穴かしら……」=“There are holes in the sand everywhere. I wonder if it's some kind of creature's den. ......”
「ねぇ、海、見てる？」=“Hey, are you looking at the ocean?”
「え、見てるわよ？　本当に綺麗ね」=“Yeah, I'm looking at you.　It's really beautiful.”
「あ……うん、そうだね」=“...... Yeah, that's right.”
